Oeieney THe Oat

Dr. H. M. Chadweld
Apt. 1217
2800 Quebec Street, N. W.

+Washington 8, D. Cc.

Dear Dr. Chadwell:
In pursuance of our telephone conversation of the other

* day, and in accordance with your request, { am confirming in

writing the results I transmitted to: you over the phone.

It is well knowm that in theadolite observations, elevations
can te generally obteined more accurately than the azimuths since
the former deperé ¥ OM accurate leveling but the latter depend
upon a determinatic of the true north, Since most theodolite
observers are interested in relative rates and not in absolute
positions, it is no surprise that they do not pay too much atten-
tion to the exact determinatian of their zero points. Further,
it 1s auite easy for even-an coserver of some experience to make
an error in reading of some muitiple of whole degrees. The
observation made at Limestone, therefore, can very well be assumed
to have both a zero point error and an incorrect seale reading.

 

At the mean time of observation, calculations made at the
observatory here show that Jupiter had, at Presque Isle, an
azimuth of 163° and an elevation of 58.5%. ‘This alone is 4 suf-
ficiently close to the mean of the readings from two stations to
serve as strong ‘vide. = that the object observec was Jupiter.
However, the clinching aQrument comes when one compares Jupiter's
rate of. motion in elevation and azimuth during the observation
and the rates noted on the theodolite, at Presque Isle. The com-
puted increment in elevation was 0,2 degrees (as compared to the
observed 0.3 degraea) and the corresponding increment in azimuth
was 1.8 degrees (as against the observed 1.9 degrees). In view
of this strikingly close agreement in rates as well as general
position in the sky, it would be an outrage to probability theory
to consider that the object observed waa anything other. than the
time-honored planet Jupiter. The prosecution rests its ease! .

“*" Wishing you the very best greeting: of the season, I remain.
Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

Bon. Gordon Scherer i
House Office Building . iy Be:
Washington 25, D.C. E

Dear Mr, Scherer: 4

Several weks ago a picture of a UFO wes show
It was the famous Brazilian UFO. It was taken on boud the Bragilisn q
Navy IGY ship in daylight and in full viev of shout a bundred pexsons. i
It was developed sboard in the presence uf the officers of the ship. }
It was certified as being authenitic by the Navy, released to the preas
by the Brazilian President himself. %k wae in the headlines of all the q
: Brazilien newspapers for a week. It created suck tremendous miblic i
} Ainterest that a Congressionel investigation followed, end aa a result 3
much more UFO information was mede public. iy

Now the Awericen Air Force has labeled this picure a hoax! ss . {

Of course I am concerned ebout the affect of this on our campaign to

get the UFO situstion opened up in this coumtry. But I am even more

concerned as to what effect this will have on our relations with Brazil. if
Toe Brazilians know esbout their UFOs. I have copies of the magazine 4
O TRUZXIRO in which many ctstending incidents ere frankly and openly a
@iscussed. I recently secsived a seven pege report on censorship in .4
Brezil from Dr. Olave lustts,. Brazil's best known UFO researcher. 4
What censorship there ts in Brazil is largely at our insistence and the .
authorities don't like even that much. ‘There have been an average of :
six to eight sightings/month for fifty moaths, and sometimes there are q
as meny es thirty in a two hour period. How are these well informed i
people going to react to hearing their President and several high Nevy E
officials called frauis? : is

You may not agree with this et present, Mr. Scherer, but the Americen

Air Force is withholding evidence even from Congressmen, and J feel strongly

thet the tine has long since cane when this dangerous situation should be d

cléared up. ATIC has now admitted hiding the Project Grudge report by :
Q merking it “secret”, and admitted that the CIA is involved in the UFO ‘
; q investigation. On the other hand it has denied many serious incidents - q

it had previously confirmed. Why, why does there have to be secrecy at 4
. elit? ‘het is the CIA covering so desperately that it is necessary to )
§ ‘ mske such incredible charges against the head of a friendly governzent? i
I heve e good uncerstending of scientific method, and I am 2% 2 crackres, P
q . ‘he Air Force “explenations" meny tines simply do not explain, and their i
7 statistics are obviously contrived. The feeling about UFOs has changed = é
in Cincinnati. There hasn't been a tongue-in-cheek article published for i
ovex e year. As General O'Keefe said last December, and Senator Johnson }
bas said recently, UFOs ave serious business, . ft

e q :, eet

q Won't you, Sir, lend your help by making a stand for open Congrez4ional

: hearings? And if you feel, you can't do that, at least do Something ako
the Brazilien affair. ‘Thank you. ° “

RELTEVE OBJECT OVER MOROCCO ONLY A METEOR ~~ Rabat, L'Echo du Maroc, 22 Sep 52

On 21 September 1952, at 1818 hours, the mysterious flying object seen in
all Morceco and beyond was observed over Rabat. It seems more likely, however, —
that thie time, it was a meteor, because the trajectory of the object was
given as rectilinear, it 41d not maneuver in the way seucers are said to do,
and sts entire body was incandescent, which is not true of flying machines.

She object vas variously described as an orange-colored ball of fire, an
arrow, or a cone-shaped object trafling a bright green-blue clout of smoke,
beading from east to west and parallel to the coast, and moving at the speed
of a conventional plane at en altitude of about 1,000 meters. The object was
visible for only a fer ssconis, After at posed @ thin, white trail of smoke
remained visible for about 5 mimites. a : et :

Three members of a family in Abidjan declared that shortly after 0130 ,
hours on 3 October 1952, & bright green light flashed from the east across the
aky, seemingly the exhaust of seme craft. The latter was momentarily motion-
less, at which time it seemed orange red in.color. Then it revolved about it-
self in a ring of fire, zig-zagging upvard and remaining in the-same area of
the sky. As it moved, 1t assumed various shapes, flat, round, epi oval. Its
eolor varied then from purple to gold. After many rapid, noiseless turns, it
dwindled in sixe, turned green, and disappeared ~- that was at about 0200 hours.

The three observers gave the impression of being quite level-headed.

LARGE METEOR EXPLODES - Stockholm, Dagens Nyheter, 10 Jen 54

A large ball of fire which was seen over large parts of Sksane, Blekinge,
Gmasland, and west coast of Sveden passed through the sky over Lund at a speed
of about 10,600 kilometers per hour at about 1616 hours on 9 January. The ball
disappeared in a westerly direction and emitted a long trail of. sparke. Accord-
ing to reports frou Denmark, the ball appeared to bave exploded over Copenhagen,
leaving a emoke formation which remained’ for 10 minutes. Some persons thought
a jet plane had exploded and others thought it was e flying seucer. Reports
streamed into the Svedish Air Force from all over southern Sweden. - .

According ‘to Bertil Lindblad of the Lund Observatory who witnessed ‘the
phenomenon, there is no doubt that it was a meteor with an-apparent diameter
of ove third that of the moon and 6 lum: ity of the moon. The trail of the
meteor vas photographed at the observatory. Observer Nielsen, at the Ole Romer
Observatory in-Aarhus, Denmark, received reports of the meteor from Aarhus and
Copenhagen. He is not of the opinion that it explod=d over Copenhagen but thinks
that the-explosion might have taken place 100 kilometers away. [The article
also conteins a request by Bertil Lindblad that persons who sav the meteor. sub-
mit written discriptions of it to hin.} *

SOVETSKAYA KULTURA of 28 October reported on the results of a
conference in Petrozavodsk of about 100 Soviet scientists representing the
"various branches of science and technology." The main topic of discussion
was the multitude of claims of recent UFO sightings in the USSR. According
to SOVETSKAYA KULTURA, more questions about UFOs vere raised at this
conference than were ansvered. — :

LITERATURNAYA GAZETA of 1 November reported that Voronezh, where some
-observers had claimed to have witnessed the landing and take-off of a UFO,
hhas become the place for a “pilgrimage” by correspondents seeking
sensational nevs for their newspapers, regardless of the controversial
mature of the so-called “veighty evidence" being presented as proof that
extraterrestrials had visited Voronezh.

SPRS-UPA-29-021
4 April 1989

It appears that such 2 “radical” position in part of the
intelligentsia may be caused by a reaction of rejection of
that se stereotype that has been artificially
imposed for many years. At the same time it is Girect
evidence of an inadequately mature civic position in
scune young people, result of equating the concepts of
teligion and morality, religion and culture. and so in the
ideas of these young

A significant number of respondents (about 30 percent)
expressed the opinion that onc of the primary reasons for
the preservation of religious feeling is shortcomings in
the system of education and indoctrination, which docs
nat adequately mold a scientific materialist worldview.
Thus, to the question, “Did the knowledge received in
these classes help you in realizing and formulating prin-
cipies and goals in life and in searching for answers to the
questions that are important to you?" 38 percent
answered, “No,” t were unable to give any
answer at afl. But this is just one aspect of the gencra!
problem of dehumanization of the system of education
and indoctrination.

Along with the intelligentsia Mer same questions
were amwered group of young believers, followers
ofthe Hare Krithaa cult. The answers to questions about
the tevel of teaching of history and literature are practi-
cally the same for both groups. But 70 percent of the
believers gave a negative assessment to the role of the
humanitarian knowledge received in school. 1f we con-
sider that the ranks of the believers are filled most often
hy emotional, suggestible types who arc casily wounded

paychologically, then the damage to their spiritual world
that is caused by the mechanical, stcrcotyped approach
to humanitarian culture could have been the initial
: (33 percent) ofthem
warpeising ity (95 percent} of them
think that religion fosters an awakening of the higher
spiritual principle in people.

RELIGION

Whilc traditional, canonical religious culture attracts the
attentina of about half of the respondents, a majority (80
percent) are interested in questions linked 10 mysterious
d of natare and the human mind (UFO's,
dclepathy, tcickinesis, the biofield, and the like). There is
a autable infatuation with dream books, horoscopes,
fortune tefling. and the like. Although 36 percent con-

_ sider all of these things 2 kind of “game™ and something

to do “from boredom,” 32 percent of the young peuple
eurveyed link fortune telling with a hope to avoid dan-

‘agers and wnplcasantness and a desire to know one’s

future, and almost as many say that they have encoun-
tered cases which verified Certain signs, predictions, and
90 on.

1 would like to point out onc other aspect of the problem
of non-traditional religion. This is that because of a
certain eclecticism and primitivism the so-called
“neocults” are unable to the religious compen-
satory function and cannot scrve as a adequate means of
individual social adaptation. Therefore. politization of
the activity of non-traditional religious groups is almost
inevitable. This is confirmed by foreign experience, and
by our own domestic experience. Most of the existing
associations which to one degree or another have a
ecligious (or pseudoreligious) orientation are drawn to
consolidation. Steps are being taken to work out com-
mon ideas and programs purpose is to form a
political organization of believers, persons united by
“space religion,” and so on.

Many Sovict social scientists are now speaking of the
“need to refine the existing pactices in classifying believ-
ers with religious organizations considering the real
processes in the ideology and activity of our country’s
religious organizations.” But while rejecting vulgar athe-
ism which has been imposed on mass consciousness for
many years, we must understand that idcalized ideas of
religion and religious organizations are also unwise and
usuatly result from inadequate theoretical literacy and
humanitarian culture,

Under conditions of continued democratization of pub-
lic life in the country the activity of religious organi-
vastions, including the non-traditional ones, will grow.
Coverall this is natural. and given all the diversity of the
situation there must be broader interaction with reli-
gious oragnizations and groups of believers in the social,
cultural, and sociopolitical spheres. Joint activity by
teligious, public, and state organizations offers an appor-
dunity for behevers to achieve sucial self-realization not

-only in the seligious sphere, but also in solving socially

significant problems. Such interaction can help reorient
the individual and mold a scientific materialist world-
view through concrete activity, through solving joint
problems that are equally important to believers and
non-believers.

FBIS TRANSLATED TEXT VILNIUS, 26 JUN -- AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING

OBJECT (UFO), SPOTTED NEAR THE LITHUANIAN BORDER ON 25 JUNE BY TWO
DUTY MOTOR POLICE PATROL OFFICERS JAUNIUS POZERA AND LAIMIS
KRAUJALIS PLACED THE WHOLE VILIUS POLICE ON THE ALERT. VEHICLE
LOADS OF SOLDIERS FROM THE ARAS RAPID REACTION FORCE, SNIFFER DOGS
AND POLICE REINFORCEMENTS IMMEDIATELY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE OF THE
EMERGENCY. , .
ACCORDING TO THE EYEWITNESS‘S ACCOUNTS, AT ABOUT 0030 IN THE
EARLY MORNING, ON THE VILNIUS-MEDININKAI ROAD, NEAR THE VILLAGE OF
NEMEZIS, 10 KM FROM THE CAPITAL, AT AN ALTITUDE OF 20-30 METERS
ABOVE THE GROUND, THEY NOTICED A SPHERICAL OBJECT HANGING AND
“PULSING," ALTERNATELY SHRINKING AND EXPANDING. AT THE SAME TIME,
THEY HEARD WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS "A STRANGE SOUND LIKE AN ELECTRIC
OR ELECTRONIC CRACKLE," WANTING TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE UFO,
THE POLICEMEN MOVED TOWARD IT. WHEN THEY HAD ADVANCED ABOUT 50

 

METERS - THROUGH THE LONG GRASS,- THE POLICE SAID, THE SPHERE MOVED ae

AWAY, ROSE HIGHER AND RAPIDLY DEPARTED IN THE DIRECTION OF VILNIUS.

THE POLICEMEN WATCHED THE UFO FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR. ON THEIR
ARRIVAL AT THE SCENE OF THE "EMERGENCY", MEMBERS OF THE CIVIL
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, SERVICEMEN FROM THE SPECIAL FORCES AND
COMMISSIONERS OF THE CAPITAL’S POLICE CAREFULLY STUDIED THE AREA,
MEASURED THE BACKGROUND RADIATION AND TAPE-RECORDED THE STRANGE
SOUND, WHICH WAS STILL HEARD IN THE AREA AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
THE UFO. THE SNIFFER DOGS DID NOT DISCOVER ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS AND
BEHAVED QUIETLY. BUT IT WAS NOTED THAT THE TALL GRASS AROUND THE
PLACE OVER WHICH THE SPHERE HAD "HUNG" WAS FLATTENED TO A RADIUS OF
10 METERS.

LITHUANIAN SCIENTISTS HAVE NOT YET EXPRESSED AN OPINION ON THE
APPEARANCE OF THIS UFO NEAR VILNIUS. POLICE COMMISSIONER VALENTINAS
JUCHNEVICIUS SAID IN A RADIO INTERVIEW TODAY THAT BOTH OFFICERS WHO
WATCHED THE SHINING OBJECT “ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY HEALTHY, NORMAL
PEOPLE, NOT NOTED FOR CRANKINESS."

PASSENGERS SAW A FLYING OBJECT OUT OF THE WINDOWS.

THE OBJECT, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL, WAS "BEAMING LIKE A
SEARCHLIGHT" AND FLYING ALONGSIDE THE PLANE. THEN THE OBJECT CHANGED
DIRECTION AND SPLIT INTO TWO--A SMALLER BALL ABOVE AND A BEAN-SHAPED
BELOW. PASSENGERS SAID THEY SAW A GREEN RING OF LIGHT AROUND THE
OBJECT.

SCIENTISTS NOW BELIEVE THAT WHAT THE PASSENGERS SAW WAS AN
IONIZED BALL OF GAS WHICH, ACCORDING TO HYDROKINETIC THEORY,
RESULTED FROM THE ELECTRIC DISCHARGE OF LIGHTNING AND SEISMIC ROCK,
AS WELL AS THE VIOLENT OSCILLATION OF ELECTROMAGNETISM IN THE AIR.

"THE EXISTENCE OF PLASMAS IN THE IONIZED STRATUM OF THE
ATMOSPHERE IS COMMON," SAID ZOU YOUSUO, ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS AT
THE INSTITUTE.

IN THE XINJIANG CASE, HE EXPLAINED, THE GAS FORMED BY ELECTRONS,
IONS, AND UNIONIZED NEUTRAL PARTICLES WAS A HIGH-FREQUENCY DISCHARGE
PLASMA APPEARING IN THE FORM OF A FIREBALL.

THE GREEN RING OF LIGHT WAS PROBABLY THE RESULT OF ELECTRIC
DISCHARGE OF A HIGH-FREQUENCY MAGNETIC FIELD.

OURSELVES THAT THOUGH PROHIBITIONS MAY WELL EXIST, VIOLATIONS OF
THESE PROHIBITION EXIST AS WELL.

THE LOWEST PERCENTAGES OF STRAW HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN SOFIA,
RAZGRAD, BURGAS, AND MIKHAYLOVGRAD OBLASTS (BETWEEN 36 AND 45
PERCENT). MARKED DIFFERENCES CAN BE NOTED IN THE WAY THE DIFFERENT
MUNICIPALITIES ARE CARRYING OUT THIS AGRICULTURAL TASK. WHEREAS A
FEW DAYS AGO VELIKO TURNOVO MUNICIPALITY HAD COMPLETED 97 PERCENT OF
THIS TASK, AND LOM MUNICIPALITY HAD COLLECTED THE STRAW FROM 86
PERCENT OF THE HARVESTED FIELDS, MIKHAYLOVGRAD MUNICIPALITY HAD ONLY
COMPLETED ONE-THIRD OF THE WORK.

OF COURSE, OBJECTIVE REASONS DO EXIST. LARGE AMOUNTS OF STRAW
LEFT OVER FROM LAST YEAR CAN BE SEEN, AND VILLAGE FARMERS ARE
REFRAINING FROM COLLECTING AND BALING THE STRAW IN ORDER TO AVOID
EXCESS EXPENDITURES (WHICH ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT). HOWEVER, THE
TRUE FARMER FINDS A WAY OUT, FOR EXAMPLE BY DISTRIBUTING UNLIMITED
AMOUNTS OF STRAW TO PRIVATE FARMERS, OR BALING IT TO KEEP IT IN
RESERVE FOR THE NEEDS OF STOCKBREEDING AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION.

EVERY SOLUTION IS GOOD IN ITS OWN WAY, BUT ONE IS ABSOLUTELY
UNACCEPTABLE, AND THAT IS BURNING!

WITHOUT MENTIONING THE DANGER PRESENTED BY STUBBLE BURNING, AND
WITHOUT CONSIDERING IN DETAIL THE LOSSES, WHICH CAN VERY EASILY
MULTIPLY (AS SUCH MATTERS ARE CLEAR TO EVERYONE), LET US REMIND
OUTSELVES OF THE EXTREMELY UNFAVORABLE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. .
MANY OF. US, IF NOT ALL, HAVE SEEN THE BLACK PATCHES CAUSED BY THE
FIRES, THE SOLL BAKED HARD AS BRICK.... THE EARTH CARRIES SUCH
WOUNDS FOR A LONG TIME, AND THEY ARE NOT EASILY CURED. .

THUS, THE "LANDING" OF SUCH "FLYING SAUCERS" MADE OF STRAW NUST
CONTINUE TO BE PROHIBITED. IF THE-TELL-TALE SIGNS OF ORANGE FLAMES
SHOULD NEVERTHELESS APPEAR ANYWHERE, OUR READERS KNOW WHOM TO INFORM
OF THE VIOLATION.

e 10:00 am on 4 A as I was checking the compass at nid-bridge through a bridge
3 ais bola I aiecoind F apne object off the starboard bow. I immediately shouted
to the Captain, vho was in the chart roor, and the Chief Mite who vas below on the
port deck, of my observation and vent out on the flying bridge myself. The object
was approximately 70' above the horizon at a distance of 12 miles. It care tovard
ug, then ran on a course reeiprocal to ours and turned off into the horizon in the
northeast. I clearly sow its shadow on the water. My impression of the object was
that it was elliptical, © not unlike a Japanese diamond box kite in shape. TI
have no idea of its size but the lencth was avout six tines the breadth and it had
a depth of from two to five feet. It made no noise and wos traveling at a tremendous
rate of speed. An it traveled through the ain, it made a spinning or wobbly motion.
After {t disappeared in the horizon, I saw it reappear several ecconds later, as~
cending at an even faster speed then when I first observed it. I have no idea what
., this object was, I never saw anything comparable te it before, and it vas one of the
" post Srightening experiences I have ever had. I roughly estimatc that the object
traveled 28 miles during the 15 seconds I had it under observation.

pa as @

; Collectorts Hote: The Chief abd Third Mates were interviewed on 8 August by tvo \
telliguuce Officers, The Captain, who was absent at that time, was interrieved \
| on 9 August by only one of the tvo intelligence Officers, In describing the }
' occurrence, the Chief and Third Mates reenaoted their behaviour at the tins of
| sighting, and the period from the time the Chief Mate saw tha object abeam mtil he
reached the after deck and saw it disappear off the starboard quarter was tined at
15 seconde, In laying the angles of observation out on a chart and asmming the
} object was ten miles distant and taking the tire into acocunt, 1t is evident it ves
| oortainly traveling at a very high rate of speed, which approximated 400 to 500 miles
1
|

per Hour, It wiTl be noted that there ie @ tremendous discrepancy between the
Captain's extimate of the speed and the estimate of the two officers which could not.
be explained as they were vary careful in making their statements and asserted that
their observations had been correct. All three men were quite evidently very much
upset by the sighting, Aside from the discrepancies, 1t was quite evident to the
Intelligence Officers who interviewed these men that they had certainly seen sone |

very wrvsual object which they could not identify but wae Just as certainly not any
conventional type of aircraft. |

missile base by emitting electromagnetic energy from some old radar.
But as soon as we activate the real missile battery, its frequency
would be picked up, and missiles could operate against it. At the
same time, there is also the system of active defense, which
presupposes using radars to detect Stealth aircraft. The Americans
and Russians have been working on this for quite some time now, and
radars of this kind do exist. However, their detection range is
still quite small, so that it does not facilitate complete ‘‘fire
preparation’’ of PVO for counteraction. I do not know whether our
army has such radar equipment.

9. [Miladinovic] Instead of the excessively optimistic assessments
of Yugoslav defensive capability, according to what you say, would it
not be more worthwhile to have the complete truth about this?

10. [Mladjenovic] The public ought to be told the real situation so
as to be completely prepared for every wartime situation, including
the hypothetical situation about which there has been so much recent
talk. It is not capitulation to say openly that there are those who
are stronger than we are. It is an objective assessment that there is
no successful defense against ‘‘invisible’’ aircraft. In case of
intervention, Yugoslavia’s RV i PVO would be destroyed for the next
20 to 30 years. All of these assessments, however, can be prevented

ourselves recently in Geneva before the eyes of the entire world. We.
can get what we want through a reasonable policy far from the war
option. Peace and a peaceful policy are our best defense.

entire journey will be made without landing or refueling.

7. In honor of the holiday Moscow PVO district commander Anatoliy
Kornukhov organized a press conference, where the above super-secret
facts were presented. Responding to a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS
question about when the PVO had last detected a UFO, the commander
said that although the radars did not pick them up, in 1989 he
witnessed a strange disappearance without a trace of the most
advanced interceptor, which was flown by an experienced pilot. During
that time a UFO sighting was reported.

Mikhaylov, who exploited yesterday's deputies meeting to expound his
anti-Yeltsin and antigovernment position, presented as a description
of the events in Moscow. The administration head called to avoid
transferring responsibility of the Moscow events to federation
members. He said: Do not instigate the people, do not call for
unsanctioned, unlawful acts. After all, someone had the time to
report to Moscow that former Deputy Mikhaylov had spoken at the
session although there was no session as such. The main goal today is
not to incite people but to organize them for conducting elections
for the State Duma, Federation Council, and local organs of power.

7. Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov signed a decree today on reforming
representative power in Sakhalin Oblast. All activities of the
oblast and smaller soviets are suspended, and sessions and
conferences are canceled. The status [word indistinct] of the
deputies is maintained. The oblast administration has taken over all
functions of representative power. Smaller soviet members will form
a commission for [word indistinct] which, to a certain extent, will
be charged with conducting the elections and working out the oblast
charter.

8. Anatoliy Aksenov, chairman of the former oblast soviet, addressed
the gathering. He said: The deputies must do everything possible to
~ww sane CUAKantee the conducting of elections on 12 December and make a sober

judgment of the situation to help create a second brarith of aut!

and stabilize the country’s situation. On his behalf and on behalf
of the deputies, Anatoliy Aksenov thanked everyone he had a chance to
work with, chairmen of the soviets, deputies of all levels, and
administration workers.

Polish air-defense system should be divided into two separate but
mutually complementary parts: a national air-defense system in charge
of zonal air defense and a military air-defense system in charge of
operational direct air defense for the purposes of troop support.

57. -The organizational structures of air defense themselves should
be simplified, especially as regards the chain of command, which
should be reduced to a minimum (while at the same time assuring a
sufficient variety of equipment for each structure).

58. -The basic elements of direct air defense should be the
reconnaissance-command-fire team (artillery battalion, battery). That
kind of defense should be, like antitank defense, propagated
throughout the military.

59. -Air defense in all of its aspects should be subordinated to the
overall national defense system, which in practical terms will mean
that the territorial division of zonal air defense would correspond
to the design of organizational structures and the scopes of
competence.

60. -In peacetime, a part of the resources of Polish air defense
should be used to monitor the airspace and as a deterrent. Allowing

oa forthe requirements of modern air defense and the directions of its [
development, it can be argued that the role of air defense will -—-—-——-—---—-__.__.

subordinate to the military department, are not going through the
best of times now. Many institutes have had their financing cut, and
the threat of closure looms. This has also affected NINGI. But
finally it became clear to its leadership that if the institute was
to survive, it had to emerge from the underground, since not only the
military requires navigational equipment. But in the words of the
deputy chief of NINGI, Captain 1st Rank Sergey Alekseyev, the
traditional curtain of secrecy surrounding the institute did not
allow it to openly use its scientific potential and rich data bank,
the results of all national hydrographic expeditions since the
twenties. According to existing instructions, scientists of the
institute could not contact colleagues from other scientific
institutions, and frequently there was duplication of research into
the identical areas by civilians and the military. **It was silly to
keep us in the background,’’ Sergey Alekseyev believes.

6. But the process of conversion, part of which was liberation from
the fetters of excessive secrecy, which recently has seemed to be
simply an anachronism, has also touched NINGI. A year ago the
decision was made to hold a scientific and technical conference at
the institute, to which all interested parties could be invited,
chiefly civilian organizations. And this conference ‘‘The Modern
Status and Problems of Naval and Air Navigation’’ was a success.
waa. Phree hundred specialists, representing the major scientific organs

and industrial facilities of Russian, the CIS countriés andthe ———-—-------——----—---
Baltics countries, for three days they shared their experience and

became acquainted with the latest developments, for which an

exhibition of new technical equipment was arranged.

 

7. Since the development of navigational equipment is a very
science-intensive task, requiring great financial expenditures,
commercial organizations were also invited to the conference. One of
them, ‘‘Tranzas marin,’’ has already concluded a contract with NINGI.

8. Now the institute is faced with a global task: creation of a
federal radio-navigation plane for Russia which combines all
information on navigation, marine as well as air and ground
navigation. One hopes that by uniting its efforts with other civilian
and military institutes, NINGI will successfully accomplish this
task.

any, finally, or not?

18. [Ivanov] I shall begin with an example. When I was the chief of
a space vehicle launching site, a general came to me and introduced
himself: the chief of an institute created especially to study these
phenomena. We sat down and talked. It turned out that all his data on
flights of unidentified objects in the North completely coincided in
time with the launches conducted in Plesetsk. The fact is that the
North has one peculiarity. It is that the atmosphere there has unique
properties. Launches in Plesetsk can be seen even in Novaya Zemlya.

19. There was a case about five years ago when three objects passed
somewhat to the side of Baykonur at a high altitude. They were
clearly visible on the radar screen. We still do not know what they

were, but it is certain that they were not airplanes. '
20. Like everyone else, I am interested in this problem. It is j
simply that I cannot deny the possibility of the existence of UFO’s }
as many people do. j

21. [Makarov] What can space do for the man on the street?

22. [Ivanov] It not only can but already is giving us a great deal.

 

 

effectiveness to catch fish, search for minerals, draw geographical
maps, warn of danger and rescue people who have suffered from
disasters, and manufacture new medical preparations and metal alloys.
Even now all a geologist or even a plain tourist has to do is take a
small and, incidentally, inexpensive instrument in order, with the
help of the GLONASS space navigation system, to know his location at
any time. Incidentally, when the Americans conducted the Desert
Storm operation, the troop commander said then that the division
commanders were the first to assess the advantages of space
communications and navigation. They were put out in the desert and
told to find the coordinates of the meeting place, and with the help
of portable navigation devices they arrived at the precise place at
the appointed time.

23. But the main thing space can help with is bringing people
together. When we experience its limitlessness, coldness, and
emptiness, the need to join forces to study and inhabit it inevitably
arises of its own accord.

38. The best-known example from more recent times was the program
for an independent Estonian economy within the Soviet Union, known as
the IME [self-managing Estonia]. It could not be published in the
party’s main newspaper RAHVA HAAL, even though one of the authors,
Siim Kallas, was that newspaper’s assistant editor in chief at the
time.

39. ‘‘So Edgar Savisaar drove to Tartu and saw to it that the
article was published in EDASI,’’ Kalmre said.

40. The fact that Tartu has now dozed off slightly is also explained
by Kalmre as being due to the circumstance that the university’s last
three rectors have been technically oriented. But now the university
has a new rector, Peeter Tulviste, who may get the city to wake up
again. He is a classical scholar and was one of the signers of the
Letter of the 40 in 1980-the protest by Estonian intellectuals
against the Russianization policy of the Brezhnev era.

41. ‘‘He is a wise and modern man, and I believe that something is
going to change at the university.’’

Butkov, chairman of the department of economic and social geography
of the Ulyanovsk Pedagogical Institute

30. The Kalinin, Kostroma, Gorkiy, Tatar, Bashkir, Dimitrovgrad and
Balakov nuclear power plants are operating, under construction or
planned for construction in the Volga-Kama basin.

31. The Scientific Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) has
been working in the city of Dimitrovgrad since 1961. It contains
eight reactors, of which five are scientific and three are
semi-industrial. Seven reactors are in operation. The output of the
nuclear power plant is 440,000 kilowatts. The NIIAR has 16 permanent
observation posts, including two in Ulyanovsk. Radioactive wastes are
pumped into the ground to a depth of 1,100~1,500 m. A
high-temperature reactor to be used to process depleted fuel was to
be built in this city as well. The reactor needed around 100,000
tonnes of high-quality graphite. Its erection would have cost __

we do not have the needed quantity of graphite and the corresponding
amount of money, the reactor was rejected.

32. Radioactive neutron sources will be produced in Dimitrovgrad
jointly with the Chinese Atomic Energy Institute. The Chinese side
intends to supply the products to countries in Asia and the Near
East. The ‘‘radioactive dirt’’ will remain in Russia.

33. In order to replenish the continually growing shortage of
electric and thermal energy, scientists propose erecting an
experimental industrial unit of a new generation on the grounds of
the NITAR in place of the reactor facility being decommissioned. Its
output would be 620,000 kilowatts of electric power and up to 215
gigacalories of thermal energy per hour.

34. Some of the nuclear power plants in the Volga region were buiit
on ground that is unsuitable in geological respects, and even simply
dangerous, often in direct proximity to active faults, and at the
intersections of river systems, where an abundance of water is
observed. Consequently we risk a misfortune on the Volga that would
be dozens of times more terrible than Chernobyl.

30. ‘‘And can it be used in some way?’’

31. ‘‘I£ you please. You could even build power plants instead of
conventional ones. But I repeat, it will all be unbelievably
primitive-water, boiling....And of course, such a converter would not
be fit for space flights.’'

32. ‘‘We have found an electric analogue of processes involving
energy conversion,’’ continues Shabetnik. ‘‘And energy can be
extracted not just from water but, let’s say, from metal as well. It
is conceivable that you could connect our converter to an electric
generator. And the output would be fourfold the energy that it could
provide while operating conventionally. A fourth could be diverted to
feed the generator, and you would have the rest as a gift from your
microworld.

33. ‘*But in reality everything is of course more complicated. In
essence, an energy converter consists of several devices working in
conjunction with one another. The main components are a closed
superconductor and control system. They are for ground needs. The
electron accelerator that is connected to the circuit transforms the
converter into a spacecraft engine. With its help, a spacecraft can
fly to Alpha Centauri and back to earth in 12 years.''

 

rn SAL Bag it been possible to recreate these procésses, if only in ~~

experiments?!’

35. ‘‘Yes. Otherwise I would never have told you anything.
According to our calculations, the energy hidden in a kilogram of
iron is completely sufficient for interstellar travel.'’

36. As far as the future is concerned, let us say straight out that
it is fantastic. Even without flights to other worlds. Indeed energy
converters will be used to meet needs on earth. The time has already
come to dream not only of miraculous generators capable of replacing
nightmarish nuclear and thermal power plants or of new means of
travel. Our entire lives will be turned around.

plug our converter into an electric generator. So on the output you
produce four times as much energy as it can generate operating in a
traditional fashion. You use one-quarter of that for generator power
supply and the remainder is available to you as a gift from the
microcosm.''

32. Yet in reality, of course, everything is a lot more complicated.
In essence, the energy converter consists of several simultaneously
operating devices. Its principal elements are a closed superconductor
and a control system. This is for terrestrial needs. But the electron
accelerator connected into the circuit turns the converter into a
space propulsor. Using it, one can reach the Alpha-Centaurus and
return back to earth in 12 years.

33. ‘‘Have you been able to replicate these processes at least
experimentally?’’

34. ‘‘Yes. Otherwise I wouldn’t be telling you anything. In our
estimates, the energy concealed in 1 kilogram of iron is quite
sufficient for an interstellar journey.’’

35. Well, the outlook is, shall we say it, quite fantastic. Even
without flying to other worlds. After all, the energy converters will
be quite suitable for earthly needs. It’s about time to start
dreaming not only about miracle generators capable of replacing

~~" plghtmarish nuclear and fossil fuel power platits, but also about new

means of conveyance. All our lives could be changed dramatically...

(3) Most of the cases reported were not only similar in form and characteristics
to reports from abroad of UFO's, but there also seems to be a rather extraordinary
correlation in the times of events. Between 1971 and 1973, the United States and
the United Kingdom experienced large numbers of eye witness accounts, and in China
the number of reports showed a small surge as well. On 18 September 1976 in
Tehran, Iran, an airforce Phantom fighter aircraft and a UFO had a combat encounter
that raised a furor, while during this same time, the number of reports increased in
China. During the summer and autumn of 1977, there was a case of UFO's in various
places in Europe, and the number of reports in China were also fairly numerous.

For example, Yuan Chenxin [5913 2182 2450] of the Institute of Paleoanthropology
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sighted a disc shaped unidentified flying object
in the forest area of Shenuongjia in Hubei Province. Fang Qing [2455 7230] and
others from the Shanxi Teachers College observed an orange-red saucer shaped un-
identified flying object at Taiyuan. On 21 October 1978, an incident took place in
Australia in which a UFO caused the disappearance of an airplane, and two days later
in China a correspondingly huge unidentified flying object of similar characteris—
tics was observed. In early 1979 in New Zealand, storms broke out everywhere and
there were corresponding reports inside China. On 17 August, a Japanese pilot
photographed a UFO, and 2200 hours on 21 August, Beijing student Wang Jianmin

[3769 1696 3046) observed in the skies over Beijing a blue dise shaped unidentified
flying cbject flying in a complex path, now fast now slow, and able to stop sudden-~
ly. On the morning of 10 November, Fan Da [5400 6671], a cadre at Danzhu Commune,
Pingnan County, Guangxi Province observed from the fourth floor of a building a
silvery oval shaped unidentified flying object that constantly spurted forth some

~-gubstance as--it-flews—-The next day an incident occured in Spain in which a UFO —-——

forced che landing of a passenger jet aircraft.

(4) By comparison with some events reported abroad, the substance of reports
currently being received in China is rather pedestrian. For example, there have
been no instances in which unidentified flying objects have caused power outages or
blotted out communications. There have been no photographs or movies taken, or
material evidence left behind. There have been no cases of peril to humans or to
social order. There certainly have been no cases of "flying saucer men." Inasmuch
as most flying objects have not outstandingly exceeded the flying ability of man-
made flying objects, it is uot impossible that some of them have been manmade ob-
jects manufactuted for special purposes.

Owing to the limitations of certain conditions, and because quite a few reports
have contained no precise dates or were recorded unscientifically, their value has
to be discounted. Among the people there are possibly numerous incidents of un-
identified aerial phenomena awaiting our investigation and analysis. We hope that
more aficionados will join in this work, and when they have sightings that they will
gee in couch by sending a letter to Cha Leping, Department of Space Physics, Wuhan
University, Wuhan.

many thousands of kilometers away, a global atmospheric or geophysical process
of a type still unknown to science is taking place. But it seemed to the
aviators only that it was somewhere close by--a typical optical illusion, so
to speak.

“But in the final analysis this explanation proved to be untenable. After
all, the aviators succeeded in determining the distance to the object.

"for this reason, there is only one conclusion that may be drawn: the Tallin
crew dealt with what we call a UFO. The fact that we now have a consistent
and detailed picture of the transformation of an unidentified flying object is
especially important. G. Lazurin's drawings also provide it with word
descriptions. : Ee

politicians have mentioned the fact that they do not recognize the
new Estonian parliament because one-third of the republic’s
population did not participate in the election, Raidal has mentioned
in reply that he does not recognize the Russian parliament, either.
His logic is that since it was elected while the Soviet Union still
existed, the present membership of parliament does not reflect
reality, specifically the confederative structure of Russia, the fact
of Chechnya’s and Tatarstan’s independence and small peoples’
striving for autonomy. Jaanus, as a figure of some importance in
politics, is declaring that he does not recognize a parliament that
is out of touch with the people, that the Estonian delegation will
not go to Moscow for negotiations any more because St. Petersburg is
Russia’ capital, and that henceforth Estonia will reach agreements
with each oblast capital and each people individually and will only
deign to direct its attention to Moscow and the Russian parliament
after new elections have been held.

11. In view of the highly eccentric composition of the new Estonian
representative organ, and knowing Jaanus as I do, I can be certain
that he really will do everything he says.

12. As This Issue Went to Press

13. The first session of the Estonian State Assembly and the second
round of presidential elections have now been held. Lennart Meri,
leader of the radicals, Estonia’s ambassador to Finland and formerly
minister of foreign affairs, has been elected President of the
Estonian Republic.

multikilometer concrete landing and takeoff strips. And ‘‘flying
saucers’’ that are not in operation will ‘‘rest’’ in the air and be
tied down with cables. The equipment will descend to the ground only
when required for repair.

10. The first stage of design testing on the ground and
technological refinements on the captive model will be completed at
the end of autumn. For simplicity, not only various components and™
assemblies but also all the systems of constructional structure and
equipment have been checked, in wind gusts that reached up to 15
meters per second. The tests confirmed the designers’s analyses in
all the most important design solutions. The second stage of the
tests lies ahead.

‘‘considerations,’’ and the state will treat the ‘‘flying saucer’’
kindly.

mechanism has not been developed for stimulating enterprises’
introduction of new kinds of products and technologies which, for
example, now lie unclaimed in excess in the space sector. Hence the
conversations about low profitability of space. But this is not the
fault, but the misfortune of cosmonautics.

28. I remember how we were asked to monitor agricultural lands from
space. In a 24~hour period we gave out a pile of data, but it
differed from that which the State Committee for Statistics gives out
by 25-30 percent, and they turned down our services. But we learned
that many fields either were smaller than according to the data of
the Agro-Industrial Committee, or they were not being used, or they
were not taken into account at all. Results of mismanagement also are
easily seen from space: trampled-down pastures, ruined rivers and
reservoirs, and the polluted atmosphere of cities. We can tell, for
example, about all the outrages which the Ministry of Land
Reclamation and Water Resources committed on Soviet land. Much is
being said now about Aral and Balkhash, but the fact is that
cosmonauts were first to sound the alarm 15 years ago. I myself went
to Pelshe, chairman of the Party Control Commission of the CPSU
Central Committee, and told him what was being done on the
Baykal-Amur Railroad and Sea of Aral. While they made certain other
decisions on the Baykal-Amur Railroad at that time, they did not for
Aral.

29. It seems our information is little needed by anyone. I
personally believe that reproaches on this matter should be addressed
to the economists above all, and the press must properly arrange the
emphasis here. Rigid communications, both direct and feedback, is
needed and then there also will be an economic effect.

30. [Kuznetsov] And the last question, which journal readers often
ask: Do you believe that our contemporaries will be eyewitnesses to
fulfillment of a Soviet lunar program?

31. [Leonov] Such a program is not envisaged before the year 2000.
But beyond that, we will see.

17. 30 September was the birthday of BALTIYSKAYA GAZETA. In having
to obtain a new license, we lost the word ‘‘independent,’’ but we did
retain this independence in substance. True, this independence does
not have much of a material support. In our calculations, the
remaining resources will last us until the new year.

18. Actually, many newspapers have found themselves in a shaky
situation today. It appears that only those backed up by state
structures (soviets, ministries, mayoralties) or financed by big
private capital will be able to survive. It is not surprising that in
this situation the press is being bought up by mafiosi groups. Some
do it to launder the party money or income from shadow economy
dealings; others want to gain power by manipulating the public
opinion. Some will say: This is what a market economy is; this
situation is new for the Soviet press but not for the world press.
There is a difference, however. In democratic countries, the state
takes upon itself the care of independent press. Any society
interested in its development must have an interest in opposition.
Independent press is the opposition; its presence is an indicator of
the society’s health. If this press disappears, so will the health.

19. I do not know whether it was this or some other reason that
moved the prime minister of the Latvian Republic Ivar Godmanis to
extend a helping hand to the press. Almost all republic newspapers
are now included in state orders for paper. The government was able
to reach an agreement on deliveries of paper from Russia. So far,
until the new year. What will happen after that-nobody knows.

20. ...A few days ago we saw the NEZAVISIMAYA BALTIYSKAYA GAZETA-no
longer ours-on Riga newsstands. The new editorial staff does not
delve into politics. They write about UFO's, rational nutrition, and
sex. The cover shows a temporary address and the editor's name. Alas,
this temporary newspaper has more chances to survive than we do. It
will be supported even if the reader loses interest in the tabloid
mishmash.

‘*‘elimination of unpromising villages,’’ the ‘‘redirecting of the
courses of the northern rivers,’’ and other pitifuly memorable
projects. And to this day, there is no economic mechanism to
encourage enterprises to adopt new products or technologies that, in
abundance, lie unclaimed in the space sector, for example. That is
where the talk of the poor profitability of space comes from. But
that’s not the space program’s fault--it’s the space program’s
misfortune.

27. %I remember how we were asked to monitor farm lands from space.
In a matter of days, we produced a mountain of information; but it
differed by 25-30 percent from the amount issued by Goskomstat [State
Committee for Statistics]. And they refused our services. We
explained that many of the fields are either smaller than indicated
by the data of the Agroprom, or are not being used, and therefore
were not included in the reckoning. The results of mismanagement are
also very visible from space: pastures trampled down, rivers and
ponds ruined, the air in cities polluted. We can talk about all the
outrages committed on Soviet soil, for example, by the Ministry of
Land Reclamation and Water Resources. There’s a lot of talk today
about the Aral Sea and Lake Balkhash. And yet, the cosmonauts were
the first to sound the alarm, 15 years ago. I myself went to Pelsha,
the chairman of the Party Control Committee of the CPSU Central
Committee, and told him what vas happening on the Baykal-Amur
Railroad and at the Aral Sea. Although certain decisions were made
with regard to the Baykal-Amur Railroad, nothing has been done for
the Aral. :

28. It seems that no one has any use for our information. I
personally feel that it is primarily the economists who should be
reproached for that. And here the press should place the emphasis
where it belongs. Good communications are needed, in both directions,
and then there will be an economic impact.

29. And the last question, often asked by the readers of our
journal: Do you think those of us living today will witness the
realization of a Soviet lunar program?

30. No such program is envisaged before the year 2000. After that,
we shall see.

37. A negative influence on the East, exerted by the Vest, was
rather that the East actively rejected all western elements, becoming
more and more archaic. However, one should not consider that
modernization of the eastern economy is inevitably to lead to the
death of traditional structures, pre-industrial civilization. The
study of economic history of the East would help understanding
economic problems of the USSR.

38. Results of the study of economic history could be applied for
forecasting trends in the following fields: global problems, studies
of economic growth and analysis of precedents.

39. UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO) IN ANCIENT CHINA
40. A.D. DIKARYOV

41. The process of emancipation of thought in China in 1980s is
particularly impressive after the spiritual vacuum of the epoch of
‘cultural revolution.’’ The thirst of the whole society for
knowledge based on the economic reforms, takes in a number of cases
the form of unofficial science. An example of such organizations is
the scientific societies of UFO fanciers with corresponding
periodicals as the revue ‘‘Feidie Tansuo’’ (‘‘Studies of Flying
Saucers’’). The efforts by Chinese scientists to find in afcient
Chinese sources ‘‘historical evidences’’ of UFO’ existence are of
particular interest for Sinologists and experts in science of
science. The activities of adherents of this new scientific trend in
China demonstrate methodology and tasks of the Chinese historical
science in general.

42. The article considers a number of concrete modern versions of
interpretation of historical materials on extraordinary flying
phenomena. A number of works criticizing the attempts to place a
historical basis under this problem, as a rule, does not dispute the
main modern concept of UFO as a product of alien mind.

enterprise is an independent goods-producer, then, apparently, one
should not become indignant that it has accumulated above-plan
reserves-- whether this be equipment, building glass or special
clothing--it has the right to sell them at the maximum price. In
‘‘exquisite’’ foreign stores the price of the goods on sale threw us
into considerable confusion; but we understood and could relate to
the fact that along with goods ‘‘for everyone’’ there are also goods
there (and this is not at all confined to luxury goods or antiques)
for the few also. Then why can we not put up with commercial stores
at home? And how is this method of drawing off the money some people
have accumulated because there were no goods to buy worse than, for
example, monetary reform, with the help of which some people are
proposing to simply confiscate this money?

48. IZVESTIYA, in short, once again returns our thoughts to the
economic recovery program, and once again faces everyone with the
choice: Either we take practical steps toward the market, or... Or
should we just talk and talk? For how long?

That would be the wisest solution, we have both radicals and
conservatives. At the same time, we must take all the valuable and
useful and sensible things offered by both of these, and include
these in our programme and get on along our own way. As for the
aspects which came in for criticism, I would limit myself to just two
approaches. Emotions carried over from meetings were present at the
conference; and there were also scientific discussions.

25. ‘‘Everything starts at the very beginning: Should state property
be left unaltered, or should we start to modernize and renew, make it
more flexible and start the process of de-etatization, given labor
collectives on this basis the freedom to decide matters independently
and to elect their manager. Or should we maintain the system of
administration by injunction. Should we move to a market with new
laws of regulating it, with flexible and mobile prices. Or should we
as before keep prices unambiguously under harsh state control. A
quite normal process is under way, not a very pleasant one, but a
normal process of counterposing and weighing up and so forth. At the
same time-~and this is also a very well known thing--the existence of
any opposition compels one to sharpen one’s instruments of argument,
compels one to weigh up more attentively the possible consequences,
which might be overlooked were there no such criticism. Altogether,
in the final analysis, if there is no destructive action and no
struggle, one can derive useful things from this, if one regards
taking account of diverse points of view as a factor making it
possible to ensure a more realistic program of action.

26. ‘*Thank you for the interest you have shown in the work of our
conference and in our commission’s work. Thank you.’’

hewspaper pages being the arena for it.

43. However, here I am writing it as still new abscesses continue
swelling on the political map of our country. Here the Lithuanians
declare Soviet border guards dismissed, there the Abkhaz declare
their republic sovereign, and in response the Georgians block a
railway. In Chelyabinsk the Russians ransack their own city due to
the lack of vodka. Armenian commandos shoot an Armenian people's
deputy calling for peace. The country, inflamed with shortages and
speculation, boils and rocks. People have begun murdering for
clothing. In Moscow retirees are drying out bread to make rusks, and
the harvest is of no use; the output of the most needed items is
falling. The resources of society are more tightly controlled by the
new national-officialdom tighter than before, and talk of a market
economy remains just that--talk. We are waiting for a program.
However nobody in the country has enough power to improve the
situation of the people even a little. Meanwhile even the small
groups of fools in the apparatus, politicos, and terrorists are now
capable of making this situation worse, which occurs on a daily
basis. Academician Shatalin was right when he softly made his remark:
‘We are proceeding toward the sovereignty of oblasts, settlements,
and streets, but we do not have the main one--the sovereignty of
individuals.’

44. Perhaps some people like living in a sovereign oblast in keeping
with the instructions of the oblast chief. However, I hope that a
considerably greater number of my fellow citizens would prefer to
become sovereign individuals in a modern, rich, and strong state
capable of defending their rights on its entire territory and
everywhere in the world. It is possible that in our case this is only
attainable through a period of emergency measures.

45. How can we walk along the blade of democratization without
falling into either a military dictatorship or the chaos of
disintegration? We will have to ponder this no matter how unpleasant
such reflections are for us. We will not find the right way if we
squint blissfully, or if we are blinded by the blood of fury and
ambition.

See, I told you so. I do not want that to happen. But this is only
possible if an attempt is not made to implement it. And if it
is...--no, I do not want that! You must not win bets at the cost of
the people’s sacrifices.

65. But I am obliged to see this result as a citizen and a scientist
and to struggle against this with all my might, which is what I am
doing. So far, it is true, without any particular success.

66. [Garifullina] Leonid Ivanovich, does the debate in parliament
reassure you, and how do you assess it in general?

67. [Abalkin] Of course, the debate does not satisfy me very much. I
observe this process at close quarters, and I feel that deputies are
under quite tough pressure both from the drafters of the programs and
from the press, which has expressed its opinion without even reading

clear to him, when he has made the choice himself, not under
pressure....

But we understand that the situation in the country is not easy. And
for the time being, however much we might want it, the country cannot
give anything even to the PVO troops which are on the very front line
and are the first to go into battle, in the difficult conditions we
are in now. Consequently we will have to maintain high combat
readiness with what we have, maintain the technical state of all
equipment, keep it well maintained, and be ready to carry out our

refers to "the political character" of cycles of attitudes toward the
publication of reports on UFO sightings. The article notes that
during politically conservative periods, Soviet censors have been
able to prohibit the publication of such reports. Unlike those "cold
periods," the Soviet Union is now in "hot times" and the public is
being encouraged to focus its attention on UFOs. The author of the
article points out that even the prestigious Academy of Sciences has
established official organs to study UFOs and disseminate information
about them.

23. The 22 February issue of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA published a report by
Krasnoyarsk militiamen who stated that two disk-shaped UFOs had
followed their patrol cars, moving slowly above them in a "parallel
course" for 3 or 4 kilometers. The militiamen maintained that when
the patrol cars stopped at the village of Drokino, one of the
"saucers" landed on a hill near the cars and harrassed them with rays
of yellow and red light before flying away.

24. The 17 February issue of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA devoted its entire
fourth page to UFOs, including a discussion of the question as to
whether or not UFOs are being flown by extraterrestrials.

25. The 24 December 1989 issue of TRUD published a report from two
deputy chiefs of the Moscow-based 27th Militia Division who claimed
that they and their subordinates had tracked a slowly moving UFO
flying at low altitude through the outskirts of Moscow. According to
TRUD, a member of the expert commission on anomalous phenomena in the
USSR Academy of Sciences, Yu. Platov, states that there is a
possibility that the militiamen mistook Venus, seen "through complex
atmospheric conditions," for a UFO.

26. The 5 December issue of SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA INDUSTRIYA described
a recent Japanese expedition to the site of the Tunguska meteorite in
Siberia. In theory, a great meteor exploded there in 1908,
destroying trees over an area of hundreds of square miles, although
no meteorite has ever been found. The Japanese team stated that
their research at the site clearly indicated that the explosion had
been caused by the crash of a nuclear- powered spacecraft. The
Japanese scientists erected a monument at the site--the first
memorial in the USSR to commemorate a UFO, according to
SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA INDUSTRIYA.

7 However, the market is dictating tough conditions to military journalists,
just as it is to "civilian" journalists, for the survival of their
publications. Therefore the editorial offices of military newspapers and
magazines are looking for new topics and changing the way in which they
present their material. It is true that some military publications, in
trying to attract readers, are filling their pages with light fiction,
detective stories, and yarns about UFO's. By doing this they are moving
away from their principal tasks -- informing servicemen about the life of
the Armed Forces, Gen. Bogdanov said in conclusion. (endall) 14 jan

When people have money ‘burning holes’ in their pockets, it endenders
criminal situations. And finally, there is a third route. Turning money
into property, into means of production, so that it works here, in Russia.
Legally. With profits for the country of their owner. If the law
enforcement organs tell me that someone is untrustworthy, I will have
nothing to do with him. However, I will not carry out an investigation
into where an investor’s money comes from.

"I took part in a top-level conversation in the General Prosecutor’s
Office. I say: A rule-of-criminal-law [ugolovno-pravovoye] state has
already been built in the country. The period of initial accumulation is
ending; capital has formed in certain sectors, and everyone knows this.
What remains? Either to allow these tendencies to develop further, in the
same direction, or it is time to summon up the courage and admit that the
shadow method of accumulating capital is not always criminal. There are
market structures which possess a great deal of money. They are actually
asking themselves the question: What next? Those who wanted to go abroad
have done so. Obviously, it is necessary to create conditions in which
money works for society.

PM2408103793TAKE2

[Text] "On the whole they agreed with me. Organized crime has a serious
economic component. Why not try to diffuse this situation by legislative
and economic measures? It is more comfortable for someone to work in a
normal, rather than a shadow environment.

"Our plan also provides for a civilized mechanism for lobbying for
reforms. This is what the experment is for -- in order to have an
opportunity to freely go to the government or parliament and give
first-hand information on the progress of transformations and make
proposals as to where the ‘rules of the game’ need to be changed. For
example, it is already clear that there is no use even thinking about
developing reforms unless the Criminal Code and tax legislation are
amended and the draft laws on private ownership of land and on mortgages
{zalog] are dug out from parliament’s backlog. You politicians-can argue
all you want to, but let people produce their goods, bake their bread, and
milk their cows."

Politicians claim that, in the current situation of dyarchy, a decisive
role could be played by an alliance of politicians who support the
president and pragmatists representing Russia’s business circles. In this
case reforms would receive the powerful social base they so badly need.
In conditions of relative equilibrium of the forces clinging to power on
the political stage in Moscow, practical leaders and the collectives
standing behind them would ensure that the reformers prevail and, most
importantly, would confirm the inevitability of transformations with
weighty economic arguments. (endall) 13 aug QUE 2411562 aug WC

Much of the content of the 31 August PRAVDA relates to the paper’s
enforced nonappearance over the past week. It publishes international
appeals to Yeltsin to authorize publication and vox pop interviews
commenting on its nonappearance.

Most of page 3 is devoted to photographs of events in Moscow during the
coup. An accompanying commentary by S. Oganyan notes that the paper’s
former editors refused to publish these photographs, and pledges: "We will
seek to work in such a way as to ensure that PRAVDA is the first paper
closed by the next junta, if there is one."

A page-6 announcement by the newsdesk soliciting "news and original ideas"
from readers declares that the paper will cover "all kinds of events, from
pure sensation to ‘insoluble’ problems of everyday life; from encounters
with ‘flying saucers’ to impromptu interviews with politicians."

The paper contains no interviews with Soviet officials -- a staple of the
"old" PRAVDA. It features more photographs and cartoons, including one
reprinted from the Paris INTERNATIONAL HERALD-TRIBUNE showing a huge
Yeltsin shaking the hand of a midget Gorbachev and saying: "Welcome back
to power, Mikhail." Photographs of an old woman praying before an altar,
her hand on her brow, and of Gorbachev in a similar posture are carried on
page 2. There are also notably more religious locutions in
correspondents’ copy than were to be found in PRAVDA before its
suspension. :
Besides reports from its own correspondents and TASS, it also carries
reports attributed to INTERFAX and REUTER. Few reports and commentaries
approach 1,000 words in length. There is a clear impression that an
effort has been made to make the paper livelier in both presentation and
COMTENES ec. eee ee eg i eget 23 —— a

PMU will file liberally ‘from this issue to convey the flavor of the
revamped PRAVDA. (endall) 31 aug F 30/20272 aug BT #9119 NNNN

sphere. Finally, he has brought relations with the Soviet Union to
their lowest level.

437. These results of the President’s military and foreign policy
are forcing many representatives of the country’s elite to recall
Talleyrand’s memorable saying: "This is worse than a crime. This is
a mistake!" And although the average American is highly impressed by
strong policies and a "strong president," he is now saying more and
more often: Stop, this is impractical! Practical politics is the art
of the possible, not just of the desirable. ...

438. I asked one of the famous U.S. political scientists in
confidence: What is the psychological explanation for the incumbent
U.S. President's fondness for nuclear games? One gets the impression
that some kind of mysterious force seems to attract him to them.
"Yes, yes, I myself have thought of this," my interlocutor said.

"And what strikes me more than anything else in this connection is
our President’s statements about the inevitability of Armageddon, the
‘end of the world.’"

439. According to religious beliefs, Armageddon is the place where

the final battle between the forces of good and evil will be fought.
At that moment God will take the affairs of mankind in his hands and
he will walk the earth and punish the sinners.

440. This is what R. Reagan said to correspondents—of-a-television————-———-——
company: "It could be that our generation will be the one to witness
Armageddon."

441. An anticommunist complex multiplied by a superstition complex
and added to a boundless faith in the military~industrial
complex--are these not rather too many complexes for just one man? .

leaders of the United States bear all responsibility for such a turn

280. Commentator Yuriy Kornilov (TASS, 30 Jan 84)

281. The U.S. Administration speaks a great deal about "the need of
a dialogue." Yet, it deadlocks, disrupts and blocks all the talks on
the problems of curbing the arms race. . - -

282. Our hands are clean, and we have never been aggressors, U.S.
President R. Reagan pointed out recently at the Congress in the State
of the Union message. This is an obvious lie. In the past 6 years
alone the U.S. Administration resorted to armed actions or the threat
of force against other states 38 times, . . -

283. The thing is that from whatever point of view we assess the
situation, it is more than obvious: The allegedly "peace-making"
tricks of Reagan and his team, brought about by the purely
time-serving considerations, have nothing to do with the real foreign
policy pursued by Washington, which is based today, the same as
before, on the desire to make history reverse its course, to reshape
the political map of the world.

Christ said to his disciples: ‘*Peace I leave with you, my peace I
give unto you: not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your
heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.’’ And if you talk about
freedom, then the most important thing here is perhaps freedom from
prejudices, which enslave a person, even when the powers-that-be do
not hamper political freedom. How often we see those who are slaves
to their own passions and prejudices ruling in a particular social
sphere! When I perform the sacrament of baptism and say ‘‘I baptize

God that brings the person freedom from sin.

people began to alarm not only ‘‘lyricists’’ but also ‘‘physicists.’’
The result has been an increased interest in extralogical, in
nondiscursive knowledge, the aspiration to achieve an integral
perception of the world instead of progress toward the triumph of
one~sided interpretation of the ‘‘scientific picture of the world.’’
It is precisely thus that an integral world outlook is developed
instead of a narrow rationally understood ‘‘scientific outlook.’’

47. Another important feature of the new world outlook should
include asserting the priority of universal human values. But then
one of the main universal human values is the planet earth, for which
reason the new thinking should encompass not only the political and
military areas but also all other areas of human activities,
particularly those related to ecology. The primacy of universal human
values is becoming increasingly important in relations among people
and in the aspiration to unite mankind within a single harmonious
family. New thinking is needed everywhere and one of its
characteristic features should be the harmonious combination of the
mind with the ‘*heart,’’ the rational with the emotional and logical
with intuitive knowledge.

targets, guns, and bombs, is the most versatile of the combat
aircraft. In addition, the Air Force has supersonic bombers SU-22M4,
armored fighter planes SU-25K, and transport planes TU-154-B-2. In
view of the natural terrain our most needed weapon is the fighter
helicopter MI-24 with a four-barrel machine gun, air-to-ground
missiles, and guided antitank missiles. It is not dependent on a
runway as are planes, and it can be effectively operational within a
few minutes. It can be easily put to peace time use, for example
during natural disasters.

10. Obviously, the reduction of the Air Force will also affect the
pilots. Here we shall have problems. The training is very demanding
and expensive. In addition, military pilots comprise a relative
unusual group which did not have enough opportunities to become
politically compromised. Of 40 generals who underwent clearance
proceedings, only two did not pass the verification commission. A
similar situation exists in case of pilots of lower rank.

 

 

11. The problems of the Air Force cannot be judged separately from
the problems of the other components of the Armed Forces. Minister
Vacek said at one time that a professional army is too expensive. It
seems that an excessive and unnecessarily expensive Air Force does
not bother any one.

although the experts I know claim that this will not be easy to
accomplish.

The Swedish side does not possess precise and clear arguments which
indisputably prove the appearance of Russian submarines in Swedish
territorial waters. All the recordings of underwater noises which have
been received from Stockholm are of a very poor quality. It is impossible
to draw from them an unequivocal conclusion about the presence of
submarines and to whom they belong. It is no accident that even the prize
of 1 million Swedish krone, announced last fall for any Russian Navy
sailor providing evidence of the borders being violated, has remained
unclaimed. In our experts’ opinions, the Swedés will have to find a way
of extricating themselves honorably from an unpleasant situation which is
of their own making.

On the other hand, our Navy’s Main Staff is also failing to give the
public clear proof that Russian submarines have never been in Swedish
waters except for the single incident in 1981.

It is being asserted that during the Swedish premier’s visit to Russia, he
and President B. Yeltsin will sign a document in which both sides will
pledge to cooperate in the search for the truth. How successful this
cooperation will be is an open question. (endall) 3 feb

took place at the Institute of Metals Physics of the Urals Scientific
Center.

Leading representatives of virtually all branches of science had assembled
here for the meeting with the USSR president.

Opening the meeting, G.A. Mesyats, chairman of the Presidium of the Urals
Scientific Center and vice-president of the USSR Academy of Sciences,
dwelt in detail on the main activities of the Urals branch of the Academy,
which now unites 38 scientific institutions, special design bureaux for
scientific instrument making, and a number of engineering centers.

The majority of those who took part in the exchange of views drew
attention to problems of the development of fundamental science, having
noted the need to raise its prestige, renew the material base, and
strengthen higher educational establishments. In particular, it was
pointed out that the interests of the development of fundamental science
and the results of the introduction of market principles in the economy
are now entering into a contradiction. A firm legislative base, which
removes this tendency, is necessary, the speakers believe.

It was said also that the scientists’ limited opportunities for developing
international contacts is one of the factors restraining progress in
science and research.

Addressing the meeting, M.S. Gorbachev said in particular: I profess the
following point of view. In politics there would be fewer mistakes,
policy well-grounded, real, and effective, if it rested on scientific
knowledge. A scientific prediction of our advance is especially topical
in the Urals, in a region which plays an immense role in the development
of the productive forces of the entire country. The Urals have taken on

 

too many of the country’s worries during the years that were difficult for
it, for us to continue exploiting it today without thinking of anything
apart from increasing capacities and labor resources.

In this hall I have heard much that is useful and interesting, M.S.
Gorbachev stressed. Now, according to him, is precisely the moment for
everyone together to think soundly about things, including the question of
how it came to pass that such a Oblast, has found itself with such old
capital stock.

Responding to the addresses by the scientists, M.S. Gorbachev noted that
he shares their concern over the state and fate of fundamental science in
the Soviet Union.

The president replied to questions by participants in the meeting
concerning both problems of scientific and technical progress and the
realities of today’s socio-political situation in the country.

In the evening a meeting between representatives of the working people of
Sverdlovsk oblast, party, war and labor veterans and M.S. Gorbachev took
place in the Youth Palace.

The participants in the meeting were addressed by M.S. Gorbachev. The
address will be published in the press. (endall) 261222

and so on. And yet, comrades, we must act responsibly and seriously, and
I will tell you the main thing clearly: We must finally prove in Russia,
this huge country, that socialism can carry out prefound changes in the
framework of democracy and legality. Everything must be done to avoid
confrontation, and civil war even more so. This group of three or four,
or whoever you like. [sentence as heard] The law must reign supreme in
our society. This is the main thing. There’s incitement again, there is
another witchhunt you see; they are looking out for the enemy; another
step and there he is, the enemy of the people; let's drag him by his feet.
What is this? The fate of Russia? The fate of socialism? We imagine
that we must ennoble ourselves in this area, in this way? That’s to say,
we are marching toward democratic, humane socialism by way of lawlessness,
by way of witchhunts again?

What is that? No, I believe that we in our country should do everything
in a good way, in a good way. Patience and restraint are required.
Therefore, I am aware of the remarks comrades have made. Many say:
Mikhail Sergeyevich, give something else! Dear comrades, we are expanding
the democratic process of building a state based on law, so that the
people themselves, through democratic processes and sessions, through
certain processes and democratic reforms within the party itself,
everywhere, in the economy, so that the people solve questions. With all
this bang, strike, disperse, catch, we will not be able to break this
vicious circle. We must become a civilized country. Our peoples deserve
better, having suffered so much and having done so much in history for the
whole world, because without our socialist contribution, the world would
have been different, totally different. And if perestroyka wins today,
the world will be totally different._Will-we-lose?._I think we will not
lose, comrades. I think painful and less painful ways are possible here.
The people cannot return to the old life, nor can their mouths be gagged.
The breath of freedom that it has received, the oxygen that our society
gets as a result of democratization and openness are what our people need.
Man had been reduced to nothing. We could no longer continue in such a
State.

Not everything works out the way one wishes it to, not everything. Faults
have been committed and we are upset because of that. Do not think that
we are people without feelings, so to speak, no, on the contrary, I think,
we have so many feelings that sometimes this prevents us from showing
decisiveness and firmness. This seems to be in evidence. But our people
have suffered to much to put them through the mill again now. The task of
tasks is to feel these ways and continue along them. I hope, dear
Uralmash workers, that you will maintain your reputation and strong
character. The country cannot live without you, nor can you live without
the country. And let us part in this spirit of mutual understanding. I
wish you great success. We will monitor and help the Uralmash.

158. The publication in the general press of the draft of the law on
atomic power engineering and its discussion before passage in the
Supreme Soviet will relieve the tension that ‘has appeared today in
society in connection with atomic power engineering.

159. The minimization of the danger is amoral, but its exaggeration,
the promotion of the spread of unverified rumors, and the invention
of all kinds of terrifying incidents, which worry people, are also
amoral. In this respect the law on the use of nuclear power will put
everything in its place.

160. OGONEK: And all the same, Anatoliy Petrovich, we cannot, after
all, say that nuclear power plants today are complete safe....

161. A.P. Aleksandrov: We cannot. A danger exists. Yet not only
scientists, but also the public are obliged to do everything in order
to reduce it. Strictly speaking, a reactor, in which physics itself
does not allow what happened at Chernobyl, has already been designed.
But time is needed in order to refine it. Passions are heating up
over operating nuclear power plants. Therefore, steps to make
monitoring more strict are also needed, a law on nuclear power
engineering is needed.

‘‘Several corrections in trajectory movement were made during the
two-day automatic flight of the Soyuz T-13, as a result of which the
spacecraft approached the Salyut-7 station at the prescribed
distance. Further closing was executed by the crew manually with the
use of a range determination apparatus and the onboard computer
system.’’ It was not reported then that Vladimir Dzhanibekov and
Viktor Savinykh executed the docking with the silent station that was
‘‘lost’’ by Mission Control Center, and that they found it only with
the data that was issued from here, from the space tracking center.

25. ...0f course the collective does not live only with celestial
distances. Here as in any garrison weddings are celebrated,
apartments which are not in surplus are awaited impatiently, there is
gossip about the shortage of commodities, there are holidays, and it
is a blessing that the military facility is situated in a refreshing
coniferous forest. But nevertheless, the main thing that determines
everyone’s mood is outer space, and more precisely monitoring it.
When I tried to distract officers from discussions about work and to
talk about everyday living matters, it did not always work out and
they only steered away from the subject. They spoke with bitterness
about the fact that frequently specialists from the space department
took credit for the tracking center’s work, and that they were being
taken advantage of because of their secrecy. You see, no one else can
spot falling fragments and pinpoint the coordinates of silent
satellites.... ee —

 

26. Here in the tracking center they understand that the process of
disarmament that has been started will not affect them--the outer
space monitoring system will be needed even when there are no armies.
The main concern is not to fall behind in the rapid exploration of
outer space in order to secure their fellow citizens from various
accidents. Indeed, the military danger from outer space has not been
removed. On the days that I was in the tracking center, the Pentagon
carried out a regular experiment in launching a powerful energy
device within the framework of the ‘‘Star Wars’’ program. It appears
that these warriors are assured this complex work for a long time. We
will not shy away from giving credit to them for their unobtrusive
work--so important and necessary in behalf of our security and
peace--which for many years has been guarded by a curtain of secrecy.

accident investigation. In connection with this, this magazine
intends to wage a determined campaign to gain legal recognition of a
pilot’s right to make a mistake, and to scrap the archaic stereotype
used in evaluating the quality of flying performance. As things stand
at present, however, a pilot is already culpable by virtue of the
fact that he has taken the controls of a fixed-wing or rotary-wing

44. The boundaries of the known and the hypothetical, which I have
tried to talk about, are very mobile. It is possible that tomorrow
they will be different: such are the rates of our renewal of
knowledge.

45. It must be said that research on the Universe has always been
accompanied by the appearance of questions, going beyond the
framework of cosmological science. Let us recall the fate of the
Dominican monk Jordano Bruno, burned at the stake by the Inquisition
in 1600. The mercilessness of the reprisals against him were not
immediately understood. After all, it would seem, the conflict was
based on highly abstract ideas about the infinite nature of space and
the multiplicity of habitable worlds! It is hard to establish the
connection to everyday life. Nevertheless, his opinions undermined
established concepts, sanctified by the Church. If the heretic was
not condemned, doubts would arise not only in the accepted picture of
the world, but also in the infallibility of the Church and power.

46. This tragic page of history illustrates the sharp world-outlook
and ideological struggle surrounding cosmological assertions, also
occurring in our time, for instance, surrounding the question of the
causes of a singular state (is this the work of God?). Man began to
think about the origin of the world long ago. The images from the

 

47. Mankind has been living in the space age, started by the flight
of Yu. Gagarin, for almost 30 years. We are seeing farther and we
know more, we are approaching a fundamentally new understanding of
the Universe that is now facing the ‘‘world of men.’’ Researching it
requires the participation of representatives of almost all sciences,
including humanitarians. It is a question both of ensuring space
flights, as well as of resolving a whole number of fundamental
problems, for instance, the problem of the existence of non-Earth
civilizations. Certain experience in interaction and some practical
scientific experience has accumulated here. However, this is a topic
for yet another author.

thanks to efforts to improve and rectify the magazine market, which
resulted in magazines continuously trying to win over readers by
presenting healthy, forward-looking, colorful, and realistic content.

6. - The national exhibition of periodicals held in Beijing in
September last year and award-giving activities for excellent
periodicals helped tighten the ties between magazines and their
readers and provided opportunities for the trade to learn from each
other by exchanging their opinions.

7. As a result, many magazines made marked improvements in aspects
ranging from content, covers, and layout, to print quality. As the
party's ideological and organizational construction is being
continuously strengthened and its ideological and political work
deepened, the demand for party magazines in society has increased
correspondingly. With social, political and economic progress,
people’s needs in cultural affairs tend to develop in multiple
orientations. Therefore, digests and collected works with ample,
informative, and pleasing contents, as well as magazines with general
interests in culture and life are in line with this trend. Another
factor for the increase of magazine circulation is smooth
distribution channels.

tolerated previously. A manifestation of this is, for example, the
loss of trust in a majority of the official and unofficial political
institutions.

36. One other trend in the mass conscience at present is its growing
mysticalness and the appearance of this we are encountering
everywhere. This involves both a belief in miracles, flying saucers,
the growing influence of various prophets, including
psychotherapists, and much else.

 

37. Finally, and most importantly, one observes a democratizing of
social conscience and this slowly is accepting democratic principles
and models of political behavior. This is manifested primarily in a
definite change in the attitude toward a pluralism of opinions, a
multiparty system, the rights of the majority and opposition and
informal structures. At the same time, for now this process is just
beginning. The transition from the old totalitarian thinking will be
rather complex and painful. In mass conscience we are still clearly
recording views of rigid control and regulation of social life,
intolerance of other opinions and leveling attitudes.

38. An important aspect which characterizes the state of social
conscience is its particular emotional background. In the current
political situation, political moods and emotions play a very marked
role. If we turn again to the previous election campaign;—we cannot—————-—---—__
help but point out that precisely emotions often determined voter
attitudes to a candidate and correspondingly influenced the voting
results. Public moods are currently very mobile and unstable and the
clearest indications characterizing the emotional state of mass
conscience are the appearance of anxiety and hope as well as abrupt
shifts from one to the other. These are the basic traits of mass
conscience established as a result of a systematic study of public
opinion among the Moscow inhabitants in 1988-1990.

37. Culture requires urgent concern. K. Marx warned about the danger
of combining a revolution and a low cultural level and concern was
voiced over this in Russian in 1917. Even if it is admitted that
positive changes occurred over the decades, there has not been the
proper optimism since no judgments have been made. Undoubtedly,
illiteracy has been eliminated, however to some degree the cultural
heritage was destroyed and it is this which preserves the wisdom of
previous generations.

38. Man should correspond to his proud name of Bomo sapiens, both as
a biological species, as a moral personality and as a social
principal.

39. V.I. Shamshurin: Certainly we must not allow a pagan denial of
the Christian culture which has come down to us or the destruction of
the higher accomplishments of modern civilization and its common
human values.

40. The hard-hearted social theories with all their reciprocal
disdain generally derive from the same primitive interpretation of
the social ideology first expressed by the Ancient Jews, the chosen
nature of one, separately taken people or social group. The
falaciousness of the various ‘‘veterinary’’ solutions to the very
complex problems of man, society (their purpose) and world history is“
not merely obvious, but also involves the blood of an enormous number
of victims and literally shouts inhumanity. When, for the sake of an
abstract scheme which justifies the inequality of people, peoples and
classes, they begin killing, then this is inadmissible from any
viewpoint, from the philosophical, the sociological, the medical and
the biological.

Arkhangelsk Oblast.

7. [Bogomolov] Here is what Gen. Oleynik, the commander of the
Cosmodrome, had to say about the benefit which Arkhangelsk Oblast
derives from the Cosmodrome.

8. [Begin recording] [Oleynik] The program can be adjusted to find
out how man’s activity is affecting the environment in Arkhangelsk
Oblast, where the ecological situation has deteriorated lately. But I
do not know the activities of the Cosmodrome for this. Rather it is
the fault of industrial enterprises located in Arkhangelsk Oblast.
Our spacecraft will be able to assess the extent of air and water
pollution, the state of forestry plantations, and the state of the
soil. We will also be able to measure the impact of human activities
in our region on the ozone layer.

9. [Bogomolov] But isn’t this very expensive? Every launch costs
many millions of rubles.

10. [Oleynik] The life of man and the future of the region are more
important than the money we plan to spend on this reserch. [end
recording]

11. [Announcer] I wholly agree with that last remark. I remind you

 

that the life of man is more precious than the money spent on™
scientific research, especially as the next generation, in other
words our children, is at stake. One hopes that our small loved ones
will be able to eat clean food, swim in clean rivers, and breathe
clean air. If they do, maybe they will be morally better than us. One
very much hopes so. :

signal not to bomb too zealously. At that time, IZVESTIYA wrote
about CBS's acknowledgement. .

14. In December 1991, General Gustafsson ordered the coast guard to
act more energetically in the event of territorial water violations,
specifically, to immediately open fire if sonar detects the presence

‘of unidentified mini-submarines about 30 meters long. Now, we assume

that measures will be even more severe. While commenting on the

aircraft. For the time being, this model is one-fifth the actual
size, but it has enabled us to thoroughly study all the aspects we
were interested in. One or two drawbacks were revealed, of course,
but generally speaking, even our boldest predictions were
justified.’

12. ‘This is interesting, too,’’ the designer continued. ‘‘Even
this small replica of the thermoplane, which is only an intermediate
link in the research and logically should be turned over for scrap,
has attracted the attention of various specialists-in communications,
ecology, and polar studies. Specific orders are already being
mentioned. Experimental prototypes of the thermoplanes are being put
together at the Ulyanovsk Aviation [Plant] now. Most likely the
series aircraft will be assembled there as well. I will point out, by
the way, that out of all the aircraft with such power today, the
thermoplane is the most ecologically clean.’’

13. So if someone sees an unusual aircraft in the sky which
resembles a giant disk in the not too distant future, he should not
be in a hurry to talk about NLO {unidentified flying objects].

village has been liberated.’’

77. Panakh Guseynov was one of the creators and leaders of the
People’s Front of Azerbaijan. Therefore, he and Elchibey are bound by
a lot of things.

78. [Guseynov] You will not believe, after all, before meeting Mr.
Abulfaz in 1986, I was one of the most orthodox and inveterate
monumental Marxists. Before enrolling in the history faculty of the
university in 1975, do you know what I did? I wrote a letter to the
government with a request to send me to Vietnam to fight for
communism. But then, later, after I became a student, I heard a lot
about Mr. Abulfaz from the boys and about his persecution, but I was
skeptical about his idea concerning the freedom of Azerbaijan. And
only then, later, after meeting him, did I realize how greatly
mistaken I had been. Incidentally, after meeting Elchibey, many
people changed their views on life.

79. ‘‘Ah, who has not made a mistake in his youth?’’ laughed the
president, who had already completed his telephone conversation, and
I noticed for the first time how a smile suited him. Our interview
was also coming to an end. While scheduled for half an hour, we had
talked for a whole hour, and could have talked even longer, but....
the president had a tight schedule and many more meetings for the _
day. And then I asked him the final question:

 

80. [Semenchenko] What does your name, Abulfaz, mean, and why did
you choose precisely the pseudonym Elchibey; after all, your real
name is Aliyev.

81. [Elchibey] Abulfaz is an Arab name, and it translates into ‘‘the
father of science and prosperity.’’ But Elchibey: El is people, elchi
is loving, favorite of the people, ambassador of the people, and bey
is a respectful particle. It can be translated as a person speaking
on behalf of the people, expressing their interests.

82. [Semenchenko] Thank you, Mr. Abulfaz, for the interview. And may
everything that your have planned that is good and right come true.

 

83. [Elchibey] And I in turn want to wish the residents of the Kuban
and all of Russia peace and prosperity. We have always been friends.
May it be that way in the future as well.

84. And with these words, the president presented the newspaper
VSYAKAYA VSYACHINA and its readers with his autograph.

actively obstructing the search for the causes of the tragedy, and
powerful pressure is being exerted for the pesticides by the foreign
: firms that supply the pyrethroids. At the same time, people abroad
: can’t even imagine exactly how the Soviet field managers can apply
| such powerful toxins. (In Khramtsov, for example, a concrete mixer is
used to prepare the pesticide solutions.)

14. Obviously, the method chosen by the visitors from Moscow to
study the problem-in assaults after each unusual incident-is
ineffective. A systematic, comprehensive study is absolutely
necessary. Leading specialists have to be involved. They have to have
highly sensitive equipment. But what are the people supposed to do
nov, wait until next summer or fall? After all, there’s no barrier at
all today to protect against misfortune.

15. Whatever version about the cause of the poisonings turns out to
be correct, this much can be said right now: The two-year drama on
the fields is a drama about the Soviet state’s stubborn neglect of
the individual.

 

16. POSTSCRIPT: While this article was in press, a commission of the
Russian Ministry of Health prepared a report on the results of work
done in Sverdlovsk Oblast. The cause of the illness was said to be
the combined action of a number of factors. The principal factors

 

adverse weather conditions. The pesticides were acquitted. Meanwhile,
the ‘‘greens’’ don’t agree with the conclusions of the medical
people-they feel that the country’s agroindustrial complex is a
criminal organization, and they are getting ready to take it to
court.

17. The commission’s report did not bring any clarity to the
matter-it failed to even comment on a number of things. What now? To
a recent remark on the ‘‘Sverdlovsk syndrome’' made by IZVESTIYA, the
RSFSR State Committee for Health and Epidemiological Inspection
answered this: ‘‘a temporary inspection committee is being
formed....a temporary science group is being formed for further
study....a letter has been sent with a request that an international
group of experts be set up....being created in Sverdlovsk is a
toxicological center equipped with modern imported equipment.../'
Those are all promises. They make people happy. But the enterprises
that are supposed to buy the instruments for the toxicological center
for hard currency are spending it for the time being primarily for
sugar and meat.

18. Could this really be us, who have jabbered so much in the past
about the importance of values common to all mankind?

near future it will be necessary to complete refinement of individual
assemblies, conduct a synthesis of new high-temperature
superconducting materials, and begin development of an airborne
vehicle prototype with a diameter of up to 5 meters and a mass of up
to 5 metric tons.

21. The Outlook

22. Many other obstacles have not been surmounted yet, of course,
but the matter is worth active study. It is necessary to be convinced
once and for all of the validity of this means of propulsion. Our
country has indisputable priority here. And if the author is correct
in obtaining materials with a superconducting effect at temperatures
of over 800 degrees C., such means of transportation may be developed
for trips at the earth’s surface: not only instead of motor vehicles,
locomotives, and diesel vessels, but airplanes as well. New booster
rockets may make their appearance. There will be advanced,
ecologically clean means of transportation. But for the present, the
manufacture of spacecraft is the most practicable. Aside from other
advantages, if these craft are spherical in shape, they are protected
by their field from most meterorites.

23. %It is interesting that models in the experiment moved like
‘*flying saucers.’’ Movements and changes in direction were
instantaneous. Who knows, perhaps V. Shabetnik has unraveled their
secret (if one exists). But this is not important if such devices
wake their appearance. We ourselves may become inhabitants of
another planet to someone else, and our earth will become cleaner and
more suitable for human life. Why hurry to migrate to other planets
and space stations? After all, the sun will be shining for everyone
even longer!

to overstrain himself, he gradually increased his records skillfully,

and higher.

market. You cannot help wondering: Is output destined for the state
making its way there in a roundabout way? That is most likely the
case. But market prices.... The customer looks at them and clutches
his chest. Who can afford meat at R80 per kilogram, butter at R50,
and eggs at R30 a dozen? Apart from our home-grown millionaires.

But what about the rest, whose monthly earnings are only enough for
around 10 days?

13. There was an old saying: ‘‘If there’s bread on the table, the

be fit for a king even without bread?

that the experience gained in the operation of the nuclear power

ultra-light aircraft for sports aviators and farmers. This product is
now being exported. And during just the first quarter of the current
year more than 200 orders have been received from the United States,
Italy, Spain, France, Britain, and other countries.

21. The Balakirev Machine Plant (which used to produce artillery)
has also been converted to a joint-stock company. One part of it
continues to turn out defense products, while another part is
preparing to make American Case tractors.

22. At the present time work is also progressing on solving the
problem of creating other comprehensive organizational-marketing
structures for the military-industrial complex. We can cite four such
structures as examples. A business center which is a semi-state
organization designed to expand the development of contacts with
domestic as well as foreign entrepreneurs; a finance company, which
includes the Defense-Industry Bank; the Russian Defense-Industry
Insurance Company; and an information association.

23. However, the changes that have taken place so far do not bear
the imprint of an integrated, systematic approach to solving the
problem of conversion in Russia. To a large extent they are of a
spontaneous nature. Nevertheless, their logic corresponds, with no
ambiguity at all, to the process of the emergence of market-type

 

relations in our country’s economy, as well as to the appearance of ~~
fundamentally new entities for managing the defense industry. And
that means that the complex’s high technological potential is being
reinforced-albeit slowly- by the appropriate market mechanisms and
its implementation at the national, as well as the international,
level. And it would be no surprise at all if the military-industrial
complex-which was renowned as the conservative portion of our
economy-with the appropriate state support were to become the
locomotive and principal financial source of Russian economic reform.
A pledge of this is its high decree of competitiveness and
material-technical preparedness for inclusion in the international

RELAXED THE FIGHT AGAINST ALL KINDS OF VIOLATIONS, THEFT, AND
SPECULATION. UNDERSTANDABLY, A GOOD DEAL OF TINE AND ATTENTION ARE
TAKEN UP BY NAGORNO-KARABAKH, BUT IS IT RIGHT WHEN AT THE BAZAAR
STATE BUTTER IS SOLD AT 50 RUBLES PER KILOGRAM AND DISABLED WAR AND
LABOR VETERANS CANNOT USE THEIR COUPONS IN THE STORES FOR ‘MONTHS AT
A TIME?

NO, SAY WHAT YOU LIKE, ONLY SOME PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT COULD BE AN
INCORRIGIBLE OPTIMIST IN AZERBAIJAN TODAY. THE INFLAMMATION CAUSED
BY THE KARABAKH CONFLICT HAS SPREAD TOO DEEP. PERHAPS THIS IS WHY
EACH PROMISING LITTLE STEP TOWARD EMERGENCE FROM THE CRISIS IS
PERCEIVED HERE AS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN A MUSTY DUNGEON. THAT
SAME R. GUSEYNOV TALKED AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A SENSATION: RESIDENTS
OF AN AZERI VILLAGE HAD DECIDED TO REPAIR THE NEGLECTED HIGHWAY THAT
RUNS TO THE ARMENIAN VILLAGE OF ARTSBASHEN (FORMERLY BASHKEND).

THEY ORGANIZED A WORK SATURDAY AND SHOWED UP WITH THEIR SHOVELS.
THEY HAD JUST STARTED TO WORK WHEN THEY SAW THREE BULLDOZERS COMING
TOWARD THEM FROM THE DIRECTION OF THEIR NEIGHBORS; THEIR DRIVERS
BEGAN TO LEVEL THE ROAD WHICH HAD UNITED THEM AT ONE TIME. THEY
WORKED LIKE THIS ALL DAY WITHOUT ANY EXTRA WORDS. LIKE IN THE GOOD
OLD DAYS...

THIS IS AN EPISODE WHICH IN OTHER, CALM AND PEACEFUL TIMES WOULD
SEEM INSIGNIFICANT. BUT HERE THE WOMEN HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT
WHEN THEY GET WATER AT THE SPRINGS, THE MEN HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
IT IN EVERY TEA HOUSE, AS THOUGH IT WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT NEWS.
AND EYEWITNESS DISCUSSIONS OF UPO LANDINGS PALE BY COMPARISON. *
SAD+s+—--BECAUSE-Z—TOO- PLACED--A-CAUTIOUS QUESTION MARK AT THE END OF
THE HEADING FOR THESE REMARKS. IN THE HOPE THAT TIME WOULD REPLACE
IT WITH AN EXCLAMATION POINT.

HELICOPTERS DROPPING PACKAGES OR PARATROOPERS. HOWEVER, THEY LATER
REALIZED THE OBJECTS WERE REALLY UFOS.

(AKRUV PETROVSKY), MEMBER OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, AND
OTHER SCIENTISTS STATE THAT UFOS ARE NO MORE THAN AIR CONTAINING A
VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF PARTICLES. THIS GETS MIXED WITH THE SURROUNDING
AIR AND ENDS UP MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARING. (PETROVSKY) STATES THAT
THESE UFOS CAN MOVE, TURN, ACCELERATE, AND DISSAPEAR IN AN INSTANT.
HE ADDS THAT THE UFOS CAN BE OBSERVED, HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT
EXTRATERRESTRIAL AIRCRAFT FROM SPACE.

1 A VAST RANGE OF SPEEDS AND WEIGETS. IT IS ALSO THEORETICALLY EASY
TO CALCULATE PERFORMANCE.

A NUMBER OF TEST SHOTS HAVE BEEN FIRED USING COSPER, ALUMINUM
AND, MORE RECENTLY, LIGHTER MATERIALS SUCH AS MAGNESIUM. THREE
TYPES OF TEST DIAGNOSTICS ARE GENERALLY USED, PARTICULARLY-FOR SPEED
MEASUREMENT: FLASH X-RAY AND LASER DOPPLER INTERFEROMETRY FOR THE
SINGLE-STAGE AND OCCASIONALLY TWO-STAGE LAUNCSERS, AND CHRONOMETRIC
SWITCHES FOR TEE THREE-STAGE LAUNCKERS.

 

PROMISES AND PROBLEMS ((SUBHEAD))

THE BEST TEST RESULTS OBTAINED TO DAT2 ARE:
= 2-STAGE: 9.5XM/S (9 GRAMS OF STEEL)
- 3-STAGE: 13.8 KM/S (1.75 GRAMS OF ALUMINUM)
THE MULTISTAGE LAUNCHER TECHNIQUE IS POTENTIALLY WELL AAPTED TO
THE STUDY OF SPACE DEBRIS, SINCE THE PROJECTILES USED ARE
ORTHOCYLINDERS WITH VARIABLE FORMATS, THAT CAN BE MODELED AND ARE
VERY GRADUALLY ACCELERATED, THANKS TO THE MULTISTAGE DESIGN AND THE
PRESENCE OF AIR LAYERS.
THE MATERIAL IS HOMOGENEOUS, DOES NOT DEFORM OURING FLIGHT, AND
TRE PROJECTILES REMAIN IN A SOLID STATE. HOWEVER, FIRING IN A
5 VACUUM MAY BE REQUIRED FOR LONG FLIGHTS TO AVOID INADVERTENT
ROTATION OR BRAKING.
THIS TECHNIQUE OFFERS A HIGH DEGREE Of FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING
MASS/SPEED GOALS, BUT PROBLEMS - MAJOR ONES - STILL EXIST, IN TERMS
OF PROJECTILE SEPARATION AND LAUNCHER COST. .
UNLIKE THE HYPERVELOCITY JETS, A LARGE AMOUNT OF MATTER IS
ACCELERATED ALONG WITH THE PROJECTILE ITSELF.
AS FOR THE SINGLE-STAGE LAUNCHERS, SEVERAL TECHNIQUES HELP TO
“ELIMINATS, OR AT LEAST LIMIT, THE “UFOS” - UNDESIRABLE FLYING
OBJECTS. ONE IS OF COURSE THE CONICAL FORM OF TEE PROJECTILE
SUPPORT RING THAT CAUSES A SLIGHT DEVIATION IN THE TRAJECTORY OF
THESE UNDESIRABLE FRAGMENTS. ANOTHER IS TO INSTALL ALONG THE
TRAJECTORY INCLINED "FRAGMENT SKIMMERS” WITH HOLES CALIBRATED
ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF THE PROJECTILE. FOR THE MULTISTAGE DESIGN,
THE WEIGHT OF TEE INTERMEDIATE STAGES CAN BE VARIED, THUS TAKING
MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE OF THE SO-CALLED "BILLIARD BALL" EFFECT: I.5., THE
COMPLETE HALT OF A STAGE WHEN IT HITS TRE NEXT ONE, AND OPTIMIZ=D
TRANSFER OF QUANTITATIVE INERTIA.
ALSO WORTH NOTING IS THE NON-NEGLIGIBLE, AND UNEXPECTED,
ADVANTAGE OFFERED BY THE ACTIVES INTERMEDIATE MEDIA, WHICH AFTER
DETONATION ARE TRANSFORMED INTO GASES THAT HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE
TARGET. ((PASSAGE OMMITTED ON COST FOR USE IN SPACE DEBRIS TESTING) )

RE OR DURING A MAGNETIC STORM THAT PEOPLE FEEL ESPECIALLY TIRED,
BECOME IRRITABLE, AND SUFFER FROM HEADACHES AND YEART PROBLEMS. IT
IS QUITE PROBABLE THAT WE ARE OBLIGATED TO A GREAT DEGREE TO THE
FOUNDERS OF NOVONIKOLAYEVSK FOR REACHING RECORD INDICES FOR HEART
AILMENTS AND MORTALITY AMONG 80 LARGE CITIES OF THE WORLD.

IS IT POSSIBLE TO CALM THE UNDERGROUND ELEMENTS? IT IS POSSIBLE,
IF THE EXTERNAL TECHNOGENIC INFLUENCE ON THE TERRITORY IS LESSENED
FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPRESS THE SCOPE OF PRODUCTION, ESPECIALLY
INDUSTRIAL, IN ZONES OF MAXIMUM GEOECOLOGICAL RISK.
“ ALSO, UFO’S ARE FREQUENTLY OBSERVED IN THE SRY OVER OUR CITIES
AND OBLASTS: SOME KIND OF ILLUMINATED OBJECTS IN TSE FORM OF
CIGARS, OVALS, AND CROSSES. THESE CELESTIAL PHENOMENA ALSO RAVE A
TECHNOGENIC ORIGIN: UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF POWERFUL SOURCES OF
ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION (RADIO STATIONS, RADARS, AND ELECTRIC
POWER TRANSMISSION LINES), THE FORMATION OF ITEMS THAT WE REFER TO
“AS UFO’S TAKES PLACE. ACCORDING TO THE MAP, LUMINESCENCES LIXE THIS
ARE AT MAXIMUM DENSITY CONCENTRATION IN TSENTRALNYY AND
ZNODOROZHNYY RAYONS AND IN THE SKY OVER THE TELEVISION CENTER,
BUT THEY ARE WIDELY SPREAD OVER THE INDUSTRIAL RIGHT BANK.
INCIDENTALLY, TO THIS DAY SPECIALISTS ARE RACKING THEIR BRAINS OVER
THE RIDDLE: WHY DO THE LUMINESCENT OBJECTS HOVER OVER TRANSMITTING
PADIOTECHNICAL FACILITIES AND ELECTRIC POWER LINES? THEY ARE EITHER
REPLENISEING THEIR ENERGY, OR THEY ARE GIVING OFF THEIR OwN ENERGY

    

 

  

THE SECRET FACTOR ( (SUBHEAD) )

SCIENTISTS ARE STILL RACKING THEIR BRAINS OVER THE RIDDLE oF
ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DOUBT
THAT THIS FACTOR IN OUR ENVIRONMENT HAS BY FAR NOT THE BEST EFFECT
ON A PERSON'S STATE OF EEALTH. THE ANTENNAS OF RADIOT=CSNICAL

: FACILITIZS ARE RECOGNIZED SOURCES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY. RADIO
IS THE MOST DEMOCRATIC (ACCESSIBLE) OF ALL THE SOURCES OF
INFORMATION AND, IT TURNS OUT, IT IS ALSO THE SOURCE OF MANY
TROUBLES. THE FIGURE THAT WE WILL NOW CITE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF:

THERE ARE 158 ENTERPRISES AND INSTITUTIONS IN OUR CITY THAT POSSESS

RADIOTECHNICAL RESOURCES THAT FORM THE ARTIFICIAL ELECTROMAGNETIC

BACKGROUND OF THE CITY. RESEARCHERS’ OBSERVATIONS SHOWED THAT UNDER

= INFLUENCE OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, CHANGES OCCUR IN THE

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM OF THE HUMAN BODY, THERE IS A WEAKENING OF '
IMMUNITY, AND THE FORMULA OF THE BLOOD IS DISRUPTED. TRE LIST COULD

BE CONTINUED...

  

I WANT QUIET, QUIET... ( (SUBHEAD))

WELL, WHILE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF SOME THINGS, THERE IS PLENTY
OF BACKGROUND NOISE IN NOVOSIBIRSK! IT IS NOT JUST THAT THERE IS
QUITE ENOUGH NOISE, THERE IS AN INEXCUSABLE LARGE AMOUNT OF IT FROM
BOTH INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AND ALL TYPES OF TRANSPORT, INCLUDING
RAILROADS AND AVIATION.

APPARAT, SPEAKING AT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONFERENCE, SAID, "THERE IS
LITTLE SCIENTIFIC CONTENT IN IT, ALTHOUGH PERHAPS WE DO NOT
UNDERSTAND." :

THE AUTHORS OF THE "INFORMATION REPORT" COMMUNICATED TO ‘THE
EDITORIAL BOARD STATE: COORDINATOR OF THE OBLAST ORGANIZATION V.
SENKO AND HIS DEPUTIES S$. KUXURIN AND L. XLENOV, "IN THE OPINION OF
RANK-AND=FILE PARTY MEMBERS AND OF THE MOSCOW LEADERSHI2, TOLERATED
ACTIONS THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PROGRAM AND RULES OF THE
LDPR, AND CAME OUT IN THE MASS INFORMATION MEDIA WITH DECLARATIONS
COMPROMISING TO THE PARTY ABOUT THE CREATION OF A FANTASTIC
“LABORATORY OF ‘TIME,’ WITH CONTACTS WITH EXTRATERRESTRIAL
CIVILIZATIONS, AND WITH GOD HIMSELF; HAVE PUBLISHED SEVERAL ISSUES
OF STRANNAYA GAZETA, WHICH NOT ONLY BEARS NO RELATION TO THE PARTY,
BUT, MOREOVER, DISCREDITS THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATS WITH ITS ABSURD
FABRICATIONS; HAVE PUBLISHED THE BOOK ’THE RUSSIAN QUESTION,’ WHICH
IS DISCOURTZEOUS WITH RESPECT TO V.V. ZHIRINOVSKIY...." ON THE OTHER
HAND, VYACHESLAV IGORYEVICH DECLARES, “ VLADIMIR VOLFOVICH LIKED THE
300K ‘THE RUSSIAN QUESTION’ VERY MUCH; ONLY THE APPARAT WAS AGAINST
ir.* .

  

SENKO IS NO BOLIVAR ( (SUBHEAD) }

THE TIME HAS COME TO ASK WHY I TURN TO THE IMAGE OF BOLIVAR--THE
HORSE FROM THE O. HENRY NOVELLA “THE ROADS THAT WE CHOOSE." HE WAS
PROMPTED BY SENKO HIMSELF. AT HIS LAST MEETING WITH JOURNALISTS
BEFORE THE CONFERENCE, HE ANNOUNCED AS MUCH: “I AM NO SOLIVAR, TO
CARRY EVERYONE." FROM FURTHER EXPLICATION, IT TRANSPIRED THAT HE
COULD IN FACT CARRY OUT THIS ROLE FURTHER, BUT NOT FOR FREE. IN HIS
WORDS, MANY LDPR COORDINATORS RECEIVE THE SALARY OF AIDES TO STATE
DUMA DEPUTIES FROM 2HIRINOVSXIY'S FACTION, AND ONE Of THESE--
IVANOV-~WAS COMMISSIONED BY VLADIMIR VOLFOVICH TO TAKE SENKO. IVANOV
ADDRESSED A PAPER TO THE NAME OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION OF
SVERDLOVSK OBLAST, WITH THE REQUEST TO DRAW UP THE APPROPRIATE
DOCUMENT, AND THE URALS COORDINATOR HIMSELF WAS PRESENTED WITH SOLID
CERTIFICATION AS A DEPUTY’S AIDE. WHEN THE INSPIRED SENXO APPEARED
AT THE OBLAST ADMINISTRATION, THERE HE WAS SHOWN ANOTHER LETTER BY
THE DEPUTY IVANOV: NOT TO CONCLUDE THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PREVIOUSLY
RECOMMENDED CANDIDACY.

"IF THIS QUESTION IS NOT RESOLVED BEFORE THE CONFERENCE, I WILL
SUSPEND MY MEMBERSHIP IN THE PARTY,” VYACHESLAV IGORYEVICH TOLD US.

HOWEVER, AS IT SEEMS TO ME, THE GIVEN QUESTION WAS NOT THE MAIN
ONE IN THE FATE OF THE COORDINATOR, FOR HE SPOKE MORE ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE. ABOUT A CONSPIRACY WITH THE AIM OF SEIZING POWER IN
THE OBLAST PARTY ORGANIZATION: “THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS AT THE
REMOVAL BY ANY MEANS (UP TO AND INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL!) OF TRUE
MEMBERS OF THE LDPR. A. VANISHED FROM BOGDANOVICH; B. FLED KAMENSK-
URALSKIY FROM TERRORISTS; AND K. DOES NOT MAKE ANY CONTACT FROM
ARTEMOVSKIY BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM KNOWN PERSONS. THERE HAVE
THREATS OF PHYSICAL REPRISALS WITH RESPECT TO SENKO."”

WHO CAN IT BE WHO IS TERRORIZING THE URALS ZHIRINOVSKIYITES? THE
COORDINATOR ANSWERED: "SOMEONE." ???

TO TELL THE TRUTH, MY SUSPICION FELL AT THAT TIME UPON S. KUKURIN
AND L. KLENOV. IT WAS THEY WHO, IN THE ABSENCE OF SENKO, PUT
TOGETHER THE PRESS CONFERENCE, WHERE THEY SPOKE MURKILY ABOUT THEIR
LEADER, ABOUT THE CONDITION OF HIS HEALTH, FROM WHICH IT BECAME
CLEAR: POWER HAD CHANGED HANDS.

COMMISSION DEPUTY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF OF THE BELARUSIAN SECURITY
COUNCIL OPERATIONAL DEPARTMENT, FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER
VALERYY TSAPKALA, AND STATE AVIATION COMMITTEES CHAIRMAN RYHOR
FYODARAW. oy

SO, ON 12 SEPTEMBER AT 0914, THE BNTIAIRCRAFT DEFENSE DETECTED A
BALLOON IN BELARUSIAN AIRSPACE. THE SERVICEMEN WERE SURPRISED BY
THE BALLOON’S UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE, SINCE THEY HAD NO INFORMATION
ABOUT IT. TRE CENTRAL COMMAND POST EXAMINED ALL APPLICATIONS ((FOR
FLIGHT PERMITS)). AS A RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION, THEY CONCLUDED
SHAT THIS FLYING OBJECT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THAT PLACE AT THAT
TIME, SINCE THERE WAS NO APPLICATION CONCERNING IT. FOLLOWING THIS,
MAJOR GENERAL VALERYY KASTENXA, COMMANDER OF THE ANTIAIRCRAFT
DEFENSE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH NORMATIVE ACTS, DECIDED TO ANNOUNCE THE
HIGHEST ALERT.

‘AT 1136 A TAKE-OFF ORDER WAS SENT TO PRUZHANY AIRFIELD. A MI-24
COMBAT HELICOPTER TOOK OFF WITH THE MISSION TO CLARIFY ALL REQUIRED
INFORMATION ABOUT THE AIRCRAFT AND TO IDENTIFY IT. IN PARTICULAR,
TEE CREW WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO APPROACH THE OBJECT CLOSER THAN 50
METERS. :

* AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME, THE CHOPPER APPROACHED THE “UFrO" AT 100
METERS. THIS TOOK PLACE 4 KILOMETERS AWAY FROM ANOTHER AIRBASE --
ASOWTSY. THE HELICOPTER CREW REPORTED THE FOLLOWING:

/"WE CAN SEZ A SMALL BALLOON OF A 3- OR 4-METER DIAMETER. aN
ATTACHMENT RESEMBLING A CLOSED FREIGHT CONTAINER HANGS ON THE ROPE.
THE ENTIRE CONSTRUCTION WEIGHS APPROXIMATELY 1 TONNE. THERE ARE NO
IDENTIFICATION SIGNS. NOBODY IS ANSWEXING INQUIRIES ON THE 121.5
MHZ INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY FREQUENCY. THE OBJECT IS MOVING AT AN
ALTITUDE OF 2,300 METERS IN A NORTH-EASTERLY DIRECTION OVER A
MILITARY AIRFIELD AND NEAR A DEPLOYMENT SITE Of STRATEGIC MISSILE
TROOP UNITS."/

THE MI-24 FIRED WARNING SHOTS FROM 600 METERS: THERE WAS NO

 

 

 

. REACTION. FOLLOWING THIS, THE AIR DEFENSE COMMANDER HIMSELF GAVE

  

THE. ORDER TO DESTROY THE BALLOON. THE HELICOPTER MANEUVERED, MADE A
180-DEGREE TURN, AND AT 1154 -~ THREE MINUTES AFTER FIRING TEE FIRST
ROUND ~- THE YOUNG CAPTAIN AGAIN PULLED THE TRIGGER Of THE HEAVY
MACHINE GUN. SOME 20 BULLETS PIERCED THE BALLOON, AND THE GONDOLA
PLUNGED FROM 2,300 METERS AND CRASHED 8 KILOMETERS EAST OF BYAROZA,
IN A FOREST NEAR’ THE VILLAGE OF KRUYLAYE.

SOON AFTER THIS, ANOTHER TWO BALLOONS WERE DETECTED. THEY WERE
ALSO WARNED BY A HELICOPTER, BUT IT DID NOT COME TO SHOOTING, SINCE
THEIR CREWS RESPONDED TO RADIO INQUIRIES AND IDENTIFIED THEIR
NATIONALITY BY DISPLAYING U.S. FLAGS. THE FIRST BALLOON LANDED IN
THE VICINITY OF ZELVA AT 1500, AND THE SECOND LANDED NEAR LUNINETS
AT 1815, AND SERVICEMEN FROM DAWYD-HARADOK ACCOMMODATED THE CREW IN
THEIR BARRACKS.

plunged from 2,300 meters and crashed 8 kilometers east of Byazoza,
in a forest near the village of Kruhlaye,

Soon after this, another two balloons were detected. They were
@iso warned by a inelicopter, but it did not come to shooting, since
their crews responded to radio inquiries and identified their
nationality by displaying U.S. flags. The first balloon landed in
the vicinity of Zelva at 1500, and the second landed near Luninets
at 1815, and servicemen from Dawyd-Haradok accommodated the crew in
their barracks.

- * searcity of operational taskings. In his ample spare time at the
unit, he began to use remote-viawing techniques to exercise his own
*spiritual and extraterrestrial interests. "Under the guise of
‘advanced training,’" he says, "I began to see what (remote-viewing]
could do. You know what I mean?" Oames’s advanced training
"targets" included apparitions of the Virgin Mary, the demise of
Atlantis ("it’s at the bottom of Lake Titicaca,” says Dames), the
“Loch Ness monster (“a dinosaur’s ghost"), and a great many flying
*saucers. "He would tell me a loc of things about Martians,"
remembers Dames’s now estranged wife Christine. "I didn’t want to
hear about it.”

While Dames was at the Fort Meade unit, stories began to
circulate about certain "unusual experiences” during remote~viewing
sessions, particularly those engaged on “advanced training" targets.
"T think he had some kind of experiences, some kind of disturbances
from unknown spirits," remembers Christine Dames. “But he didn’t
care -- he welcomed the challenge.“

"We thrived on adventure," Dames remembers proudly. "You get men
of action -~ we’re not satisfied with sitting around and twiddling
our thumbs year after year," says Dames. "Unless something happens,
you’re going to lose our interest. But there was enough happening
in there to hold our interest."

Dames left the unit in 1989, and formed a company, Psi Tech, to
make commercial use of his remote-viewing skills. But his clients
were few and far between. He separated from his wife and moved to
Albuquerque, New Mexico, believing that the nearby deserts harboured
a hidden Martian civilisation. A wilderness prophet for our time,
he predicted to the local media that in August 1992, the aliens
would arise from their desert dwellings, shocking the world. When I
saw him in 1994, Ed Dames was almost out of money.

MOST OF the remote-viewers I’ve talked to are willing to admit,
when pressed, that their craft does have its psychiatric hazards. As

| with any prolonged and forced alteration of consciousness, it

promotes altered states and a general mental instability, and thus
can be dangerous for those who are inherently unstable. They also
point out that in the absence of regular independent verification,
remote-viewing can quick}y become a generator of idiosyncratic
fantasy. As Mel Riley says, "without feedback, your remote-viewing
turns to shit."

And without proper oversight, it seems, the remote-viewing
programme turned foul, too, slowly strangled by its own isolation.

Following the Irangate scandal of 1987, Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci had instituted a wide-ranging review of potentially
embarrassing Pentagon programs, and in 1988, a Defense Department
Inspector General’s (IG):team descended on the remote-viewing unit’s
offices, demanding to see the files.

THE SERB-HELD TOWNS IN WESTERN BOSNIA CONQUERED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS
‘BY CROATIAN FORCES, SAYING "GLAMOC, ON THE FRONT LINE, IS A GHOST
TOWN. ‘TWELVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS HAVE DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR,
PERHAPS FLEEING TOWARDS DRVAR, A DESPERATE FLIGHT OF REFUGEES
TOWARDS THE UNKNOWN AND, FERHAPS, THE IGNOBLE."

CORRIERE DELLA SERA INJECTED A SINISTER NOTE INTO ITS REPORT ON
THE CROAT ADVANCE, WRITING "NOW, IN THE CONQUERED SERB TOWNS, THE

BOSNIAN-CROAT MILITIA, IN THEIR BMWS AND MERCEDES. TREY ARE HARD,
UNSMILING. TREY HAVE ATTACK DOGS ON LEASHES AND ON THEIR LAPELS
THEY WEAR STRANGE BLACK EAGLES WHICH RECALL FAR-OFF TIMES: THESE ARE
THE MEN OF THE VOJNA POLICISA, THE MILITARY POLICE.”

"PERHAPS THEIR LATEST STARTLING EVIDENCE IS FALSE... THERE ARE TOO
MANY DUBIOUS THINGS ABOUT THAT VIDZO, SAYS THE SUNDAY TIMES.
ACCORDING TO SPECIAL EFFECTS EXPERTS, ‘IT’S A GOOD FAKE’.

"IN ONE SEQUENCE OF THE FILM, THEN-PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN [S

RESEARCH ON THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RADIATION. IN 1966 HE PUBLISHED
A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF THYRCIOLN IN ERYTHROPOLESTS IN IRKAOIATED
ANIMALS. FROM 1966 TO HIS CURRENT ASSIGNMENT, INAL AKOYEV APPLIEO

IN MEN EXPOSED TO WHOLE BODY IRRADIATION, THE BIOLOGICAL DANGER OF
EXTREME HIGH ENERGY PARTICLES OF SPACE RACIATION AND THE BLORYTHYM OF
ZONE FORMING FUNGI (AN EXPERIMENT DONE DURING THE 1975 APOLLO SGYUZ

AS TECHNICALLY INVALID. IN 1976 INAL AKCYEV WAS STUCYING COSMIC Ray

Associated Press release; William J.

This Earth (and U.S.),” The New York
Times, 18 September 1994, p. 1; and
USAF Col. Richard L. Weaver and

Ise Le. James McAndrew, The Roswell

Mexico Desert (Washington, DC:

See Good, Above Top Secret, Moore
and S. T. Friedman, “Philip Klass and
M§J-12: What are the Facts,” (Bur-
bank California: Fair-Witness Project,
1988), Publication Number 1290;
Klass, “New Evidence of MJ-12

An Analytical Report (Burbank, Cali-
fornia: Fair-Wicness Project, 1990),
Publication Number 1500. Walter
Bedell Smith supposedly replaced For-
restal on 1 August 1950 following
Forrestal’s death. All members listed
were deceased when the MJ-i2 “docu-
ments” surfaced in 1984. See Peebles,
Watch the Skies, pp. 258-268.

Dr. Larcy Bland, editor of The George
C. Marshall Papers, discovered that one
of che so-called Majestic-i2 docu-
ments was a complete fraud. [t
contained the exact same language as a
leccer from Marshall co Presidencial
candidate Thomas Dewey regarding
che “Magic” intercepts in 1944. The
daces and names had been altered and
“Magic” changed to “Majic.” More-
over, ic was a photocopy, not an
original. No original MJ-12 docu-
ments have ever surfaced. Telephone
conversation between che auchor and
Bland, 29 August 1994.

BEFORE OR DURING A MAGNETIC STORM THAT PEOPLE FEEL ESPECIALLY TIRED,
BECOME IRRITABLE, AND SUFFER FROM HEADACHES AND HEART PROBLEMS. IT
I§ QUITE PROBABLE THAT WE ARE OBLIGATED TO A GREAT DEGREE TO THE
FOUNDERS OF NOVONIKOLAYEVSK FOR REACHING RECORD INDICES FOR HEART
AILMENTS AND MORTALITY AMONG 80 LARGE CITIES OF THE WORLD.

IS IT POSSIBLE TO CALM THE UNDERGROUND ELEMENTS? IT IS POSSIBLE,

_[F THE EXTERNAL TECHNOGENIC INFLUENCE ON THE TERRITORY IS LESSENED.
FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPRESS THE SCOPE OF PRODUCTION, ESPECIALLY
INDUSTRIAL, IN ZONES OF MAXIMUM GEOECOLOGICAL RISK. .

* ALSO, UFO’S ARE FREQUENTLY OBSERVED IN THE SKY OVER OUR CITIES
AND OBLASTS: SOME KIND OF ILLUMINATED OBJECTS IN THE FORM OF
CIGARS, OVALS, AND CROSSES. THESE CELESTIAL PHENOMENA ALSO HAVE A
TECHNOGENIC ORIGIN: UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF POWERFUL SOURCES OF
ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION (RADIO STATIONS, RADARS, AND ELECTRIC
POWER TRANSMISSION LINES), THE FORMATION OF ITEMS THAT WE REFER TO

*AS UFO’S TAKES PLACE. ACCORDING TO THE MAP, LUMINESCENCES LIKE THIS
ARE AT MAXIMUM DENSITY CONCENTRATION IN TSENTRALNYY AND
ZHELEZNODOROZHNYY RAYONS AND IN THE SKY OVER THE TELEVISION CENTER,
BUT THEY ARE WIDELY SPREAD OVER THE INDUSTRIAL RIGRT BANK.
INCIDENTALLY, TO THIS DAY SPECIALISTS ARE RACKING THEIR BRAINS OVER
THE RIDDLE: WHY DO THE LUMINESCENT OBJECTS HOVER OVER TRANSMITTING
RADIOTECHNICAL FACILITIES AND ELECTRIC POWER LINES? THEY ARE EITHER
REPLENISHING THEIR ENERGY, OR THEY ARE GIVING OFF THEIR OWN ENERGY

HERE.

{RE SECRET FACTOR ( (SUBHEAD) )

SCIENTISTS ARE STILL RACKING THEIR BRAINS OVER THE RIDDLE OF
ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DOUBT
{THAT THIS FACTOR IN OUR ENVIRONMENT HAS BY FAR NOT THE BEST EFFECT
ON A PERSON’S STATE OF EEALTH. THE ANTENNAS OF RADIOTECENICAL
FACILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED SOURCES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY. RADIO
IS THE MOST DEMOCRATIC (ACCESSIBLE) OF ALL THE SOURCES OF
“INFORMATION AND, IT TURNS OUT, IT IS ALSO THE SOURCE OF MANY
YROUBLES. THE FIGURE THAT WE WILL NOW CITE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF:

THERE ARE 158 ENTERPRISES AND INSTITUTIONS IN OUR CITY THAT POSSESS
RADIOTECHNICAL RESOURCES THAT FORM THE ARTIFICIAL ELECTROMAGNETIC |
BACKGROUND OF THE CITY. RESEARCHERS’ OBSERVATIONS SHOWED THAT UNDER
TRE INFLUENCE OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, CHANGES OCCUR IN THE
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM OF THE HUMAN BODY, THERE IS A WEAKENING OF
IMMUNITY, AND THE FORMULA OF THE BLOOD IS DISRUPTED. THE LIST COULD
BE CONTINUED...

I WANT QUIET, QUIET... ((SUBBEAD))

WELL, WHILE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF SOME THINGS, ‘THERE IS PLENTY
OF BACKGROUND NOISE IN NOVOSIBIRSK! IT IS NOT JUST THAT: THERE IS
QUITE ENOUGH NOISE, THERE IS AN INEXCUSABLE LARGE AMOUNT. OF IT FROM
BOTH INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AND ALL TYPES OF TRANSPORT, INCLUDING
RAILROADS AND AVIATION. :

CAN THESE THINGS Bu. DONE GROPINGLY, WITH CLOSED . .2S?

((SMAHA)) OF COURSE NOT. THERE IS A TEMPEST OF SCIENTIFIC
DISCUSSION ON CHERNOBYL. SCIENTIST VIKTOR SEDLETSKYY, IN
PARTICULAR, ONCE WROTE IN VECHIRNIYY KYYIV THAT THE CHERNOBYL-2 AND
LUBYCR POWER PLANTS WERE DESIGNED AS A SINGLE COMPLEX, AIMED AT
CONDUCTING PSYCHOPHYSICAL WARFARE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS?

({USATENKO)) ‘NOTHING. HOW CAN WE DISCUSS ANYTHING WITHOUT.
SPECIFIC DATA? HOWEVER, WHEN I LIVED IN KHARKOV, I MET A GENERAL
WHO HAD BEEN COMMANDER OF THE "CHERNOBYL-2" FACILITY. HE SERVED IN
ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS. I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT HIS WORDS. HE
CLAIMED THAT AN EARLY-WARNING RADAR STATION WAS LOCATED IN CHERNOBYL
AND WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO CIVILIANS. IN FULL ORDER. JI HAVE SEEN AN
INVENTORY OF EVERYTHING, INCLUDING SOLDIERS’ BOOTS AND SPOONS. IF
WE COMPARE IT WITH THE INVENTORY OF THE SAME FACILITY COMPILED IN
THE FALL OF 1993, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE STATION HAS BEEN LOOTED.
SOME 5.8 KG OF GOLD, PLATINUM, AND OTHER PRECIOUS METALS WERE IN THE
STATION'S TWO COMPUTERS. PERHAPS, WHILE SEARCHING FOR GOLD, LOOTERS
STRIPPED 1,100 BOXES OF UNIQUE EQUIPMENT. IT RAS TURNED OUT THAT ~
SOME COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES USED TO: OPERATE AT "CHERNOBYL-2." 70
CONCEAL THEIR THIEVERY, ATTEMPTS ARE NOW BEING MADE TO TRANSFER THIS
FACILITY UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE "SHELTER" SCIENTIFIC-
TECHNOLOGICAL CENTER. WHAT VIKTOR SEDLETSKYY CLAIMS SOUNDS QUITE
FANTASTIC. HOWEVER, WHAT IS GOING ON AT "CHERNOBYL~2" IS :
UNDOUBTEDLY A CRIME. WHO WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE?

((SMAHA)) TIME WILL TELL. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR OPINION:
ABOUT ANOTHER VECHIRNIY KYYIV ARTICLE, THE ONE BY PHYSICIST
OLEKSANDR KOVALEVSKYY. HE CLAIMS THAT THE ACCUMULATION OF CRITICAL
MASS IN THE RESIDUAL FUEL OF CHERNOBYL’S FOURTH UNIT IS CONTINUING,
AND THAT IT WILL SOON EXPLODE, HE EVEN CITES THE EXACT DATE OF THE
EXPLOSION, WHICH WILL PUT AN END TO HUMAN CIVILIZATION. DO YOU
BELIEVE THAT? :

((USATENKO)) -I ONLY BELIEVE IN THINGS I KNOW. AS FOR
KOVALEVSKYY'S CLAIMS, I CAN ONLY SAY THAT HIS THEORY SHOULD BE .
RESEARCHED AND ASSESSED BY RESPONSIBLE AND QUALIFIED EXPERTS. IT IS
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO SIMPLY DISREGARD SUCH THINGS. A LOT OF
THINGS ARE GOING ON IN CHERNOBYL THAT ARE BEYOND RATIONAL
EXPLANATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE. TAKE FOR
INSTANCE THE WELL-KNOWN PHENOMENON CALLED ST. ELMO'S FIRE, OBSERVED
ON THE EVE OF VOLCANO ERUPTIONS AND EARTHQUAKES. THERE IS A LARGE
GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WHO CLAIM THAT THE SHINING OVER THE UNIT DURING
THE ACCIDENT RESEMBLED ST, ELMOQ’S FIRES. DOES THIS MEAN THAT WE
WERE DEALING WITH SOME UNKNOWN STATE OF MATTER?

THERE IS CERTAIN "BLACK MAGIC" IN ALL THE FIRES AT THE CHERNOBYL
POWER PLANT (THERE WERE MORE THAN 30 OF THEM BETWEEN 1986 AND 1991).
*DURING THE FIRE OF 1991, "FLYING SAUCERS" WERE ALLEGEDLY OBSERVED .
OVER THE STATION. FRANKLY SPEAKING, I DO NOT BELIEVE IN ALL THAT
GIBBERISH. I THINK THAT THE MOST SHOCKING FACTS ARE CITED IN THE
GOVERNMENT COMMISSION'S COMMUNIQUE REGARDING THE CAUSE OF THE 1991
FIRE: "THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY AN INADEQUATE ASSESSMENT OF THE
SITUATION BY THE STATION'S STAFF." THAT HAPPENED JUST FIVE YEARS
AFTER THE 1986 ACCIDENT! IN 1993, ANOTHER FIRE BROKE OUT, WHICH
ALMOST PUT THE WORLD ON THE VERGE OF A NEW CATASTROPHE. THE: CAUSES
BEHIND THIS FIRE ARE EQUALLY STRANGE -- A RELAY SWITCH AND POWER
CABLE SPONTANEOUSLY CAUGHT FIRE. REGULATIONS AT ANY STATION, NOT
ONLY A NUCLEAR ONE, ENVISION REGULAR INSPECTION OF CABLES. IT IS
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE STATION'S STAFF DID NOT DO THAT. THIS HAS
A FLAVOR OF MYSTICISM. ‘

BEGINS A MASS BELIEF IN ALIENS, UFONS, EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION, AND
MUCH ELSE. THIS IS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON, YOU KNOW. I SPOKE OF THIS

MANY YEARS AGO. THIS SITUATION BEGAN TO BE MANIFESTED CLEARLY IN

THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES. WAY BACK THEN I USED TO
APPEAR AND SAY HOW SOCIAL COLLISIONS GIVE RISE TO SUCH A BELIEF.
AND SO THE "500 DAYS" PROGRAM ALSO CONTAINED A KIND OF MYSTERY
EFFECT. NO ONE HAD YET SEEN IT, BUT THE IDEA OF ITS
MIRACLE-WORKING PROPERTIES WAS BEING PURPOSEFULLY AND
SYSTEMATICALLY INCULCATED IN THE MASS CONSCIOUSNESS.

BUT WHEN THE PROGRAM IS PLACED ON THE TABLE, WHEN EVERYONE CAN.
READ IT, PERCEIVE SOME CONTRADICTIONS AND SHORTCOMINGS, OR, AT ANY
RATE, TAKE A CONSCIOUS AND CRITICAL APPROACH TO ITS CALCULATIONS
AND AUTHENTICITY, THE MYSTERY EFFECT. VANISHES. BUT THE TIME WHICH
ELAPSES BEFORE THE DECISIOX IS ADOPTED IS DESTRUCTIVE. AND SO
PEOPLE WANT TO ADOPT THE PROGRAM AS’ QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, WITHOUT
PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS, ON TRUST ALONE. “LET'S
BELIEVE . SUCH NAMES ARE THERE, SUCH HUMANE AIMS ARE PROCLAIMED.
LET'S ADOPT IT, AND THEN WE CAN SEE. WE WILL AMEND IT, FINISH IT

NOTHING AT ALL HAS RAPPENED BEFORE 1 OCTOBER. AND. YET THERE IS

BEEN ADOPTED, AND THE LAW ON THE POPULATION'S INCOME TAX HAS BEEN

at the White Sands Missile Range were interviewed. Letters were
written to industrial companies engaged in lunar vehicle research
activity. The companies were extremely cooperative, but to no avail.
The Air Force Materials Laboratory analyzed soil samples from the
landing area. ;

The findings were altogether negative. No other witnesses could
be located. There were no unidentified helicopters or aircraft in the
area. Radar installations at Holloman AFB and at Albuquerque
observed no unusual blips; but the down-range Holloman MTI radar, .
closest to Socorro, had been closed down for the day at 1600 hours.
There was no unusual meteorological activity, no thunderstorms;
the weather was windy but clear. There were no markings of any
sort in the area except the shallow “tracks” Chaves and Zamora found.
The soil analysis disclosed no foreign material. Radiation was normal
for the “tracks” and surrounding area. Laboratory analysis of the
bumed brush showed no chemicals that could have been propellant
residue,

The object was traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour

when it disappeared over the mountain, according to Zamora’s best

guess of the time it took. Not an interplanetary speed, at any rate;
and the findings are also negative for any indication that the Socorro
UFO was of extraterrestrial origin or that it presented a threat to
the security of the United States.

conjecture. According to this scenarlo, the enemy fixed the launch
and fired a return salvo whitch the Kursk managed to dodge with an
antitorpedo maneuver. Our submarine soared up from a depth of 84
maters to 38 and prepared to surface -- the ralsed antennas on the
sall tndicate thts. And then the most unexpected thing may have
happened: The Kursk was hit during the countermove 4 a torpedo
from the second submarine (the one tt had not noticed). This time
the Russian submartne did not manage to dodge...

An Interesting fact: A few days after this, as one of our
sources Informed us, a certain Western spectal service carried out
satellite photoaraphy of the Kursk !ying on the bottom of the
Barents Sea. The concluston of the foretgn experts was this: The
nature of che —_ e to the eee ett hc ibee lout the sea bed é
are consfstent with...a torpe n close ng bya s a
a distance of 24-25 cables Eabout 4,538 meters). F

However, If belleve all of thts and think that the foretgn
experts correctly analyzed the sttuation that led to the sinking of
the Kursk, Lt remains unclear why our submarine did not report e
underwater battle by radfo.

-..The other day Putin and Clinton had an unplanned 25-m!inute
telephone conversation the detafis of which are befng kept secret.

P.S. At the Navy Maln Staff press service we were Informed that
puong. the offictal theortes that exist at present, only the
hypothas!s of a colliston between the Russian submarine and a
foreign submarine ts belng constdered. The theory about damage to

WENT DOWN INTO THE HALF-BASEMENT, DUCKED INTO AN OFFICE, AND THEN
TOOK JUST AS LONG TO GET BACK. “ ence DID UNDERSTAND half I,

GROWN PERSON, WAS FOLLOWING HIM AROUND AS IF I WERE A LEASH," ‘
THE WOMAN WONDERED. THE_INVE STTOATION CHECKED OUT THIS THREAD TOO
AND SORTED IT OUT WITH THAT SORRY EXCUSE FOR_AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD
DECIDED TO GO INTO BUSINESS ON THE SIDE. HE TURNED OUT TO HAVE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, BUT THAT’S NOT THE POINT.

VISITING THE INSTITUTE PERSON AUTOMATICALLY LOSES HIS SENSE
OF FEAR AND STOPS ANTLEYEREING DANGER. WE FEELS AT HOME. INSIDE THE
INSTITUTE YOU COULD GET GIRLS TO GO ANYWHERE UNDER ANY PRETEXT. ANY
TEACHER, MALE OR FEMALE, HIGHT ASK: "ARE YOU A COED? HAVE YOU
ENTERED? DOING YOUR PRACTICAL WORK? HELP ME CARRY THESE BLANKS .
CBOOKS, SUPPLEMENTS, PAPERS FORMS)." THE NATURE OF THE
DISAPPEARANCES SPEAKS TO THE Fact THAT THE GIRLS HAD BEEN SNARED IN
A VERY SUBTLE PSYEHOLOGICAL WAY

PHAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS DURING YOUR ENTRANCE
EXAMS?" THE INVESTIGATORS ASKED FIRST-YEAR COEDS IMMEDIATELY. THE
PERPLEXED COEDS SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS.

"WHO WOULD YOU ABSOLUTELY NEVER TRUST, AND WHO, ON THE
CONTRARY, WOULD YOU FOLLOW WITHOUT QUESTION?™ I ASKED THES IN THE
HALLWAY, TRYING TO COME UP WITH A_FORMULA FOR SOMEONE A 17-YEAR-OLD
GIRL MIGHT HYEOTHETICALLY TRUST. I CAME UP WITH THIS: 184 PERCENT
WOULD SHY AWAY FROM A) A MAN, B) ESPECIALLY A YOUNG MAN, C)
ESPECIALLY ONE WITH A DISTINCT CAUCASIAN PER EARANCE:: IN WHAT
INSTANCE WOULD THE DEFENSE SYSTEM NOT KICK IN? IF A REQUEST WAS
RADE BY A) A TEACHER, B) AN ELDERLY MAN, 3B) SOMEONE THEIR OWN AGE,
D> A WOMAN THEIR MAMA‘S AGE.

"EVERYONE IS TRYING _TO FIND SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS. BUT WE NEED
TO MODEL SITUATIONS THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY PUT THEM ON THEIR
GUARD," ADVISED ANATOLIY SUPRUN, HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
PSYCHOLOGY, SOHMUNICR CATIONS, AND PSYCHOTECHNOLOGY AT ALTAY STATE
UNIVERSITY, TO WHOM LC TURNED FOR ASSISTANCE. "THIS SYSTEM MAY EVEN
HAVE MISFIRED SEVERAL TIMES. FOR SOME REASON OTHER COEDS REFUSED TO
GO ALONG WITH THE REQUEST, SO THE ANCIDENTS MIGHT NOT HAVE STUCK IN
THEA MEMORY. ALL THE COEDS WERE IN A DEFINITE EMOTIONAL STATE OF
HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS. MOREOVER, OVER THE THRESHOLD OF THE
AHSELTOTAON WHERE THEY PLANNED TO SPEND FIVE YEARS, THEIR MINDSET
OF TRUST AUTOHATICALLY KICKED IN. AND IF SOMEONE REPRESENTING
HIMSELF AS PART O E ADMINISTRATION AT THE UNIVERSITY THE COED
WAS TRYING TO Ger INTO URNS TO HER WITH A REQUEST: "TAKE THESE
DOCUMENTS TO MY CAR," YESTERDAY ’S SCHOOLGIRLS WOULD HAVE AGREED
WITHOUT THINKING. THIS MAN ERIGNT NOT_EVEN BE A TEACHER, BUT HE HAS
TO GO IN AND OUT OF ene GFFICES AND TALK WITH FRIENDS--SO THAT
YOU ‘D THINK HE BELONGED
UNREALISTIC SCENARIOS

T_ SEEMS WE “VE GUESSED HOW HE MANAGED TO_LEAD THE GIRLS OUTSIDE
THE UNIVERSITY WALLS. WHAT REMAINS ARE THE BIG QUESTIONS: WHO LED
THEM AWAY AND FOR WHAT PURPOSET

THE BITTER JOKE ABOUT HE OTL BEING TAKEN BY UFOS THAT THE
ERVEST GATORS TOSSED AROUND IN THEIR POWERLESSNESS IMMEDIATELY
OUND CONFIRMATION IN THE MUNICIPAL PRESS, WHICH FOUND WITNESSES TO
A WHITE SPHERE THAT FIRST FLEW OVER BARNAUL, THEN TURNED BLUE, THEN
RED, AND MOVED OFF. ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE FOR A SAUCER IF THIS
TERRIBLE STORY NEVER DOES HAVE A CONCLUSION.

ALSO NOT VERY PLAUSIBLE IS THE IDEA OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL BOMB AND
A CHECHEN TRAIL. THE RESULT IS THAT. THE CITY IS FRIGHTENED: Bt BUT

0 OR WHA ID
WHICH SINS THEY WERE UppOseD TO PAY FOR, THIS THE PEOPLE OF ”
BARNAUL STILL DON “T UNDERSTAND.

The prob loa “+ global nature Is also reflected by the fact that
| a a S$ Not alone with [ts Brop lea, Danone has also announced

simllar closures In France, Belgtum, the Netherlands and Italy, the
: paper says.

Referrtng to the old traditions of the Hungarian biscult
factory “as part of the national culture", the paper says: "the
plan a ght be justified In bustness terms, but certainly not In
social terms".

In the Ifght of large-scale protests by emplouees and
sympathetic consumers, the paper even questions the business
rationale behind the deciston:

"It ts doubtful whether the outrage will not have a fatal =
“Impact on Danone".

* UFO sector tn recession

At a time when International groups such as Danone and Mark and
Spencer have announced closing plans whitch have given rise to
strong protests ty France, the French LE FIGARO decrtes another
closure, t In Britain thts time.

x "The very official British Flying Saucer Bureau has stopped Its
celestial activities after half of a century at the service of
xUFOs," the paper says In a kind of pamphlet on today’s worsd.

"But, this time, profits have nothing to do with It. It ts
the alfens who are to blame and even French Communist Leader Robert
me i powerless against that," It continues with the same hit of
rony.

* "One must know that the flying saucer sector Is In recesston,"
1t says, quoting figures: "The 1,538 ufologists working for the
xBureau used to report about 3f UFOs a year and today? Nothing,
nothing at all!®.

According to the head of the Bureau, the reason ts _ probably
that "our cousins from ‘overplanets “ have fintshed thelr sctentifitc
programme of exploration".

For a full 10 years, the Serb and the Croat nationalists have
sabotaged every part of the Dayton Agreement that, after all, makes
a state out of B-H, without the West ever responding to them with a
serious countermeasure. It is as if there is a hidden plan to shape
our reality and determine our lives. In the meantime, our attention
is turned to the daily performance in a political circus involving
domestic and foreign artists acting together. There are white
pigeons coming out of their black hats. True, no applause is
expected, because the esteemed public is already bored by the one
and only program, but the illusion is kept.

The hunt for Karadzic is also a part of that circus. If they do
not arrest him this summer, the NATO leaders will somehow come up
with an answer. Maybe this one: “We have done all we could, but a
cat cannot catch a mouse that it cannot see."

and that he does not agree with Yilmaz that national security

In the first of an unspecified number of installments of an
article entitled "It is Getting Hotter" on page 3, Zaman columnist
Ahmet Turan Alkan comments sarcastically on the causes of "alien

*interest" in Turkey indicated by recent UFO sightings. "The Turks
are like no other people. The way they react to events is
different and enigmatic. The nation is able to maintain a falc

cedillajade of normality in the face of absolutely awful governance

. Although the country appears to have a government when viewed
from outer space, it is very difficult to determine who is
governing Turkey."

In a 650-word article entitled "A Long and Arduous Process" on
page 10, Zaman columnist Ali Bulac criticizes the recent European
Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling upholding the closure of the
Welfare party (RP), accusing the ECHR of issuing a verdict based on
a critical assessment of Islam rather than the RP’s platform.

*by UFO second time in one year
Text of report by Radio Russia on 24 August

* Unidentified flying objects have again been spotted in the sky
above Tyumen Region's Nizhniy Tavda District. For two nights ina
row they could be seen above the District's capital and the nearby
lakes and rivers.

The RIA news agency reports that this is this year's second
*appearance of UFOs above Nizhniy Tavda. Last time an unidentified
*flying object was witnessed by local residents on 1 January. Then a

huge sphere was seen hovering above the settlement [of Nizhniy

Tavda] and sending eight rays of light towards the ground.

‘| This time, the UFO presented itself in two forms: that of a
sphere and a saucer. In addition, local residents are claiming that
they saw an almost 100-m-long aircraft with two evenly glowing
sidelights. The flying object was moving very slowly and without
producing any noise whatsoever.

The residents of Nizhniy Tavda are now trying to fathom what is
*it that drives UFOs to their small, quiet and not in any way

distinguished settlement buried in the Siberian sticks.

“research bases" in Caspian Sea

Text of unattributed report by Azerbaijani newspaper 525 qazet
*on 25 August entitled "A flying saucer appears over the Caspian
again"

* Unidentified flying objects have become more active over the
Caspian Sea. Last week, residents of some villages near Baku
sighted alien objects again. Some villages even had blackouts when

*UFOs flew over the Caspian Sea.

According to information given to Olaylar news agency by Fuad
Qasimov, head of the seismology department of the Azerbaijani

*National Aerospace Agency, UFOs have research bases in the Caspian.
It is possible to observe them mainly over the villages of Pirsagi,

*Nardaran and Suvalan. Apart from the Caspian, UFOs have bases in
the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, Iran, Africa and in several
American states. Qasimov said that the latest event was filmed on

amateur video.

resolution against what it calls "disguised forms of racism" in
Russia. This is said to include using illegal migration as an
excuse to discriminate on racial and ethnic grounds.

VREMYA NOVOSTEY also predicts that Russia "will have to listen
to accusations of ethnic discrimination" over its conduct in
Chechnya at the South African forum.

At the same time, the paper says, the Russian delegation is
concerned about the agenda of the conference. A call by some
delegates to pay compensation to the descendants of slaves in the
USA is seen as "not constructive" by the Russians.

The Russian delegates also “categorically disagree” with a draft
resolution equating Zionism with racism and intend to support the
USA and Israel on this issue. One delegate told the paper the
resolution would have “direct and very negative consequences in
Russia in the form of an increase in anti-Semitism".

The head of the Israeli delegation, which cancelled its
attendance at the conference at the last minute, told the paper it
was likely to be "a theatre of the absurd". VREMYA NOVOSTEY says
the Zionism resolution has also been criticized by the Russian
Foreign Ministry as "discriminatory and focusing attention only on
what is of interest to Arab politicians”.

“encrypted greetings message in Russian and an English-Russian
dictionary "to help the aliens translate the Russian text".

people, the paper says "why can't journalists experiment on
ufologists?"

Stay young, don't drive

Driving can make you old before your time, according to research
done in St Petersburg. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reports that the
Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology in the city has been
doing research on the effect of the work you do on the decline of
mental powers in specific groups.

The institute compared a group of lorry drivers and machine
Operators, paired by age, length of service, family circumstances
and education and was amazed to find that the drivers aged much
faster than the factory workers.

While the machinists all showed a decline in mental ability
after 60, the drivers showed the same decline earlier. Those who
had been driving for 20 years had the same mental decline as the
factory workers at 60.

The conclusion is: "Don't spend a long time at the wheel and
change your job," ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA says. The paper adds that
no~one knows why this happens but speculates it might be the result
of long periods alone in the cab.

against the top military leadership of Ukraine are possible as a
result of the investigation into the Tu-154 airline disaster over
the Black Sea. [omitted: parliament backed this initiative today -

Russian Deputy Prosecutor-General Sergey Fridinskiy said today
that the investigation into the blowing up of the Sibir airlines
plane which led to the death of 78 people will be completed by the
Ukrainian courts. As he put it, the state commission has every
reason to believe that the Tu-154 was brought down by a missile and
the relevant evidence has already been passed on to Kiev.

16. Incident Reported in Argentina's South Atlantic

Airspace -- Clairin's Ushuaia correspondent Wilmar Caballero
reports that in the South Atlantic an airplane of the Tierra del
Fuego provincial government encountered some very unsettling
intermittent flashes of light when it was flying over the Comodoro
Rivadavia area, 75 miles off the coast of Argentina. The pilots and
Lieutenant Governor of Tierra del Fuego Daniel Gallo ruled out the
*possibility of those lights coming from UFOs or being an
atmospheric phenomenon. They believe that the intermittent
flashes of light that followed them for approximately an hour came
from a combat airplane, possibly a Phatom or a British Tornado,
whose base is in Mount Pleasant, located on the Malvinas Islands,
because of its flight performance. This is a very serious report
since it would involve the violation of the Argentine airspace.

The airplane took off from Jorge Newbery metropolitan airport, in
Buenos Aires, at 2050 on Monday and was expected to arrive at its
destination -~ Rio Grande -- after midnight. "When flying over
Comodoro Rivadiavia 75 miles off the coast of Argentina, we saw for
the first time the intermittent lights at our left. These were
following us at: a close distance, in the same direction, and at a
higher altitude and speed," said Commander Zalotti. The lights
followed them until they reached the Straight of Magellan.
Yesterday the British Embassy in Buenos Aires strongly denied the
possibility of a British airplane being involved in this incident
and ruled out the presence of British airplanes in the vicinity.
Furthermore, the British Embassy termed this incident "senseless
speculations." Air Force Press Chief Commander Jorge Reta affirmed,
"The pilot of the Lear jet only reported that he was seeing
intermittent flashes of light, therefore it is a lack of
responsibility to say that there was an alleged airplane, which he
did not recognize, belonging to a foreign air force." He added
that if a pilot witnesses an abnormal situation he must communicate
this to the control tower. "The commander did not do so and instead
he has made statements to the press," Reta said. Furthermore,

A RUSSIAN OFFICER. IT IS A PROVOCATIVE QUESTION. BUT SUCH ACTIONS
ARE NOT ONLY BEING ADDRESSED TO SPECIFIC PERSONS. THE ORGAN OF THE
UKRAINIAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, UKRAINSKI OBRII, WRITES AS FOLLOWS
ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE ANDREYEV FLAG, WHICH IS SACRED FOR THE RUSSIAN
SAILOR: “FOR 200 YEARS THE ANDREYEV FLAG COVERED UP THE ROTTENNESS
OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE. NOW THEY WANT IT TO COVER UP THE CRETINISM OF
THE CIS. ENOUGH!"

BUT, GENERALLY SPEAKING, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE UKRAINIAN
PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF ADOPTING A HOSTILE ATTITUDE TOWARD RUSSIA. WE
MAY SPEAK, THEREFORE, OF A WHOLLY NEGLIGIBLE, RECKLESS GROUP OF
UKRAINIAN NATIONALISTS, CHIEFLY OF A WESTERN UKRAINIAN PERSUASION.
AND UNLESS THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE IN THE PRESENT
POLICY COURSE, I. BELIEVE THAT BIG INTERNAL UPHEAVALS ‘AWAIT UKRAINE.

(CUGLANOV)) -ARE CONSCRIPTS BEING DRAFTED FOR RUSSIA FROM OTHER
REPUBLICS?

((KOTENKOV)) NOT AS YET. ALTHOUGH AT THE RECENT COUNCIL OF
DEFENSE MINISTERS ON 28-29 APRIL, WHICH WAS HELD IN MOSCOW, IT WAS A
QUESTION OF A NUMBER OF CIS STATES BEING PREPARED TO MAKE THEIR
CONSCRIPTS AVAILABLE FOR SERVICE IN THE CIS JOINT ARMED FORCES, ON
THE TERRITORY OF RUSSIA INCLUDED.

 SEARON)) WILL COSSACK UNITS BE FORMED IN THE SPHERE OF THE DON

a THERE IS NO FULLY FINISHED CONCEPT OF THE
ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES AS YET. A
STRUGGLE OF IDEAS IS UNDER WAY, AND I WOULD NOT CARE TO DWELL ON |
THIS. BUT SUCH AN ASPECT OF MILITARY ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS
POSSIBLE. IT COULD BE A QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL RESERVES. WITHIN a _

—----THE-FRAMEWORK-OF SUCH A PROFESSIONAL RESERVE I WHOLLY ALLOW OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF COSSACK UNITS. WITH THE OBSERVANCE
OF COSSACK TRADITIONS, SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, FIRM DISCIPLINE AND,
POSSIBLY, PAID SERVICE. SUCH A VERSION IS POSSIBLE.

CCUGLANOV)) AND, FINALLY, RUMORS, PERHAPS, HAVE REACHED ME TO THE
EFFECT THAT UP UNTIL RECENTLY A NUMBER OF TOP SCIENTISTS HAD BEEN
ENLISTED IN A STUDY OF UFO'S AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE MINISTRY OF
DEFENSE. I AM TALKING ABOUT SOME FRAGMENTS OR WHOLE "ARTICLES,"
WHICH ARE BEING KEPT SECRET IN HANGARS AND UNDERGOING TESTS.

((KOTENKOV)) WORK IS BEING PERFORMED ON THE GLOBAL MONITORING OF
SPACE AND THE AIR SPACE ON THE TERRITORY OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.
ALL UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS ARE RECORDED. ANY OBJECT ENTERING
THE FIELD OF VISION OF OUR EARLY WARNING STATIONS I5, OF COURSE,
MONITORED. BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY OBJECTS BEING STORED AND
STUDIED ANYWHERE.

LIKE FAMILY MEMBERS OF MOST OTHER VICTIMS, WANG WENXIANG, SAD
FROM THE BEREAVEMENT OF HIS BROTHER, SAID CALMLY: NOW THAT THE
DISASTER HAS OCCURRED AND THE DECEASED CANNOT COME BACK TO LIFE, WE
ONLY HOPE THE AIRLINE WILL SERIOUSLY AND STRICTLY LOOK INTO THE ROOT
CAUSE OF THE DISASTER AND THAT RELEVANT QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE
AIRLINE AND THE AIRPLANE MANUFACTURER, WILL DRAW A LESSON FROM THE
DISASTER IN ORDER TO AVOID THE RECURRENCE OF THIS KIND OF VICIOUS
DISASTER.

HE ALSO MADE A VEILED CRITICISM OF THE TIMELINESS AND
TRANSPARENCE OF THE MEDIA'S REPORTS AFTER THE DISASTER OCCURRED. HE
SAID THAT SINCE CHINA PURSUES REFORM AND OPENING UP IN VARIOUS
ASPECTS, INCLUDING NEWS REPORTING, IT SHOULD, WITH AN ATTITUDE OF
REFORM, REPORT THE SITUATION TRUTHFULLY AND QUICKLY. CHINA SOUTHERN
AIRLINES IS AN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE AND FLIES MANY INTERNATIONAL
AIR ROUTES. MOREOVER, IT IS OPENING UP THE BROAD INTERNATIONAL
MARKET. THEREFORE, AS A FAMILY MEMBER OF THE DISASTER VICTIM, HE
HOPED RELEVANT AUTHORITIES WOULD, PROCEEDING FROM INTERNATIONAL
PRACTICE AND FROM THE ANGLE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS OF THE
AIRLINE ITSELF, APPROPRIATELY HANDLE THE QUESTION OF CONSOLING
FAMILY MEMBERS OF DISASTER VICTIMS AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE MASS
MEDIA. :

ABOUT FIVE OR SIX OTHERS.

THE MET OFFICE SAID SIMILAR SIGHTINGS HAD ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN
